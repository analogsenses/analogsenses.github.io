  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello there, welcome to another issue of <em>Morning Coffee</em>.</p>

<p>This week I want to take a look at the final game of the UEFA Champions League, which was contested by Real Madrid and Atlético de Madrid yesterday in Milano. For the second time in just three years, these two teams from the same city competed for the most prestigious title in European football — wait, I mean soccer.</p>

<h2>Issue #42: The UEFA Champions League trophy goes back to Madrid</h2>

<p>What a game. Not that we haven’t seen it before, though.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Real Madrid won the title in heroic fashion, after Sergio Ramos scored a goal in the nick of time to tie the scoreboard at 1-1 and send the game into the overtime, saving his team from certain defeat. In the overtime, Real Madrid were just fresher and capitalized on the shift in momentum, taking the game 4-1. It was a cruel defeat for Atlético’s fans, who saw the trophy slip right through their fingers, despite almost touching it for the better part of 90 minutes.</p>

<p>This time around, it was once again Real Madrid that took the trophy home, and it was an even tougher defeat for Atlético, if that’s even possible. An early goal by Sergio Ramos — again — put Real Madrid in the lead, and Atlético were forced to adjust their strategy, playing in a way that does not come naturally to them.</p>

<p>Much to their credit, they did an excellent job and managed to create a few clear goal chances, only to see them foiled at the last second. They even missed a penalty kick in the beginning of the second half, something that is extremely difficult to put behind when the stakes are this high.</p>

<p>But if Atlético have one character trait as team, it is their absolute refusal to give up. They kept pressing on and eventually, Yannick Carrasco somehow found the perfect way to finish a tremendous offensive play and put the scoreboard back on level terms. It was back to square one.</p>

<p>By that point there were only 15 minutes left and both teams were understandably cautious, so there weren’t any more serious chances for either team before the referee signaled the end of the 90-minute game. Just like in Lisbon two years ago, the final was headed into the overtime.</p>

<p>However, this year there would be no glorious victory in the overtime, no epic goals and, frankly, not much to speak of at all. Both teams were exhausted due to the extreme physicality of the game, and most players were just trying to make it to the end, fighting the cramps and the pain in order to remain in play. Some, like Filipe Luis, didn’t make it and had to be replaced. Others, like Gareth Bale, managed to hold on through sheer force of will.</p>

<p>It was time for the penalties.</p>

<p>Whenever a game of this magnitude has to be decided by a penalty shootout, there’s always drama. Some people say penalty shootouts are cruel, and unfair. I disagree. I believe in sports, you need to make your own luck.</p>

<p>Losing by the narrowest of margins always stings, but such is the way of the game. And so, when Juanfran missed the penalty that would ultimately bring down Atlético, the look on his face was heartbreaking, but he shouldn’t be the one to blame. After all, both teams had 120 minutes to earn the trophy and the simple truth is, both failed to do so. Just like victories are team efforts, defeats too must be endured collectively.</p>

<p>I have no doubt Atlético will recover. Another admirable character trait they share is their utter belief in hard work as the only valid path to greatness. They believe soccer is a meritocracy, and that the best team is the one that wins. That sounds like a simple enough philosophy, but Atlético have proven time and time again that they actually live by it, which is a lot harder than it seems, especially on nights like this.</p>

<p>For Real Madrid, last night was one for the history books: 11 Champions League titles, and counting. No other team comes even close to those numbers, and it’s time for a well-deserved celebration. For Atlético, on the other hand, it’s time to get back to work.</p>

<p>Fortunately, nobody does it better than them.</p>

<h2>Top Five: Uncharted 4, a missing parrot, Google’s CEO, and the perils of losing our free will</h2>

<p>This week’s selection comes to you fresh off the presses. Enjoy.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/uncharted-4-director-neil-druckmann-on-nathan-drake-sexism-in-games-20160524">’Uncharted 4’ Director Neil Druckmann on Nathan Drake, Sexism in Games (SPOILER ALERT) | Chris Suellentrop →</a></h3>

<p>This was a really great interview with Uncharted 4’s creative director Neil Druckmann for Rolling Stone. I love how straightforward and down-to-earth this guy is. It’s kind of crazy when you realize he’s been responsible for several of the greatest video games of all time, some of which have budgets comparable to Hollywood blockbuster movies.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♤</p>


<h3><a href="http://allenchou.net/2016/05/a-brain-dump-of-what-i-worked-on-for-uncharted-4/">A Brain Dump of What I Worked on for Uncharted 4 | Allen Chou →</a></h3>

<p>Another Uncharted 4 link for you, this time from Allen Chou, one of the developers who worked on the game. I love these behind-the-scenes pieces, and it’s always interesting to learn just how much work it takes to create a game like Uncharted 4. really impressive stuff.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♧</p>


<h3><a href="http://digg.com/2016/parrot-witness-protection">The Strange Tale of Echo, the Parrot Who Saw Too Much | Laurel Braitman →</a></h3>

<p>This is priceless. A parrot that used to belong to a New Orleans crime boss has disappeared, and people are looking for him because, get this, they want to put him in a witness protection program.</p>

<p>Apparently, the parrot was saying things he really shouldn’t be saying, and some people think he could provide critical testimony that could help put his owner away. I know how ridiculous that sounds, but it looks like it’s not all BS:</p>

<blockquote><p>Certain species in particular, can be spot-on imitators of the sounds around them—from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXUrVXtCprU">mundane cell phone conversation</a> of their owners to <a href="https://youtu.be/GcbYHWUnE0I?t=23s">calling the family dog by name</a> and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G268RE6GR4Y">bark just like them</a>. They can mimic the beep of a microwave or a cell-phone ring so closely that it’s confusing. Sometimes they mimic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M8jxB0LZeA">other things people do too</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know this is a serious matter, but it’s hard not to laugh at that last one.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♡</p>


<h3><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathonan/searching-for-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-the-most-powerful-tec">Searching for Sundar Pichai | Mat Honan →</a></h3>

<p>This was an interesting profile on Google’s CEO. Come to think of it, I knew almost nothing about the man, which seems kind of crazy considering how huge a company Google is, and how much media attention it garners.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♢</p>


<h3><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/">There’s No Such Thing as Free Will  | Stephen Cave →</a></h3>

<p>And here’s your existential piece of the week. There are lots of troubling ideas to consider here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Determinism not only undermines blame, Smilansky argues; it also undermines praise. Imagine I do risk my life by jumping into enemy territory to perform a daring mission. Afterward, people will say that I had no choice, that my feats were merely, in Smilansky’s phrase, “an unfolding of the given,” and therefore hardly praiseworthy. And just as undermining blame would remove an obstacle to acting wickedly, so undermining praise would remove an incentive to do good. Our heroes would seem less inspiring, he argues, our achievements less noteworthy, and soon we would sink into decadence and despondency.</p></blockquote>

<p>So basically, the day we stop believing in free will, we become total assholes. Food for thought.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♤</p>


<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>How’s your week been? Mine has been interesting. I’m now working on a review of <a href="http://amzn.to/1OVriPq"><em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em></a>, after thoroughly enjoying the heck out of that game. It’s been a truly impressive experience, and definitely the prettiest game I’ve ever seen. If I had to rank it, it would place a close second to <a href="http://amzn.to/1TQgU0X"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> in my all-time list, but that’s only because <em>The Last of Us</em> is so emotional and character-driven that it really transcends the medium.</p>

<p>Other than that, things seem a bit quieter than usual on the Internet, although the calm is definitely not going to last. With WWDC just around the corner, we’re about to go from 0 to 60 in the blink of an eye, so I’ll happily take the down time now.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, and have a great Sunday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Solid essay by Richard J. Anderson on the likely implications of the music industry changing from a streaming-first to a streaming-only business model:</p>

<blockquote><p>It feels like the move to streaming music means we’re losing something. What happens to music that isn’t available on a streaming service? How will you explore the music of a surprisingly good opening band when they don’t exist in the library of Apple Music, Spotify, or TIDAL? So much music that has touched my soul, you can’t stream it for love or money. I had to seek it out on my own, pawing through used music bins, or going to shows. When there’s an all-you-can eat buffet for $9.99, what’s the incentive to order something that isn’t on the menu?</p></blockquote>

<p>Excellent point. The convenience of music streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music cannot be overstated, but I love owning my music, and I’m not about to stop doing it anytime soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello there, welcome to another issue of <em>Morning Coffee</em>.</p>

<p>Yesterday I started playing one of the most widely anticipated video games of all time: <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Tc2LfU">Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</a></em>. This is perhaps the first game that pushes the PS4 hardware clearly beyond what last-gen consoles were capable of doing, and it’s remarkable in its own right for being the last entry in Naughty Dog’s extremely popular <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1qlvVvK">Uncharted</a></em> series.</p>

<p><em>Uncharted 4</em> has been a long time in the making. This series is the reason I bought a PS3 a few years ago, and I have to say I’ve enjoyed each chapter with the wide-eyed enthusiasm of a ten-year-old kid. These games offer a cinematic experience that is easily on par with big budget Hollywood films, and now with <em>Uncharted 4</em>, Naughty Dog has raised the bar significantly, delivering a true work of art in video game form.</p>

<p>Not that it’s their first time, mind you.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog has a long and rich history of delivering masterpieces, but in my mind there’s one particular game that sits head and shoulders above everything else we’ve ever seen in the industry. That’s what I’d love to tell you about today.</p>

<h2>Issue #41: The Last of Us (No Spoilers)</h2>

<p>Let me preface this by saying I don’t consider myself a gamer in the popular sense of the term. I’ve only played a handful of PS3 games — literally — and I only bought the PS4 this week to be able to play <em>Uncharted 4</em>. I’m not crazy about beating skill-based games, or spending hundreds of hours building a character in a made-up universe — with perhaps one or two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3sBZ5Nr4hc">notable exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>My ambitions when it comes to gaming are fairly modest: have fun, and experience truly compelling stories. That’s why I love the <em>Uncharted</em> series, and the recent <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1TeJ561">Tomb Raider</a></em> reboot. They’re just lots of fun to play, but they’re also incredible stories, told in a medium with an unparalleled capacity for immersion. If you’ve ever cried at the movies, you probably know what I’m talking about. Great games offer the same experience, only dialed up to eleven.</p>

<p>However, every once in a while there comes a game so remarkable that it fully and completely transcends the previously known limitations of the medium and becomes something else entirely. These are incredibly rare, and may come only once in a generation. <em><a href="http://amzn.to/251XIEq">The Last of Us</a></em> is exactly that kind of game.</p>

<p>On its face, the premise of the game seems fairly simple: set in a dystopian future where a virus has wiped out most of the human race and turned them into fungi-shaped zombies, two mean-spirited scavengers are tasked with smuggling a teenage girl out of a quarantine zone. So far, nothing seems out of the ordinary: just another zombie-ridden survival game, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>What sets <em>The Last of Us</em> apart from many other games is the depth and complexity of its characters. There are zombies in the game, yes, but the story is never about them. It’s not even about the Fireflies, a so-called resistance group that’s apparently looking for a cure. <em>The Last of Us</em> tells a story that is much smaller in scope, but much bigger in relevance. It’s the story of a broken man and a lost girl, both of whom stubbornly refuse to give up even in the face of insurmountable odds. It’s a story about family, and love. A story about growing up, and learning to let go.</p>

<p>Right from the beginning, <em>The Last of Us</em> punches you in the stomach with a scene so poignant and tragic that you have no choice but to instantly empathize with Joel, the main playable character in the game. By bearing witness to this traumatic event, we’re prepared to understand — if not quite forgive — Joel for any questionable actions he may go on to commit over the course of the story. And boy, does he commit them. Clearly, you don’t get to survive long in a zombie apocalypse by being nice.</p>

<p>Ellie, on the other hand, represents the polar opposite of Joel. She was born after the world had already ended, so this life is all she’s ever known. She hasn’t had to go through the incredibly difficult process of losing everything we take for granted, and that has given her the rare ability to remain innocent in a world dominated by cruelty and violence. While Joel broke a long time ago, Ellie somehow manages to bend instead.</p>

<p>And so, while there’s a fair amount of killing to do — both zombie and human killing, mind you — and lots of huge areas to traverse and gorgeous sets to explore, to me the most compelling aspect of <em>The Last of Us</em> is being able to witness the complex and nuanced relationship that slowly develops between Joel and Ellie. He teaches her to find the strength to do whatever it takes to survive, and she teaches him that there’s more to life than surviving. It’s a long and powerful journey during which both characters change profoundly — and hopefully, so do we.</p>

<p>I won’t get into any more specifics here, because if you haven’t played the game, spoiling it would be cruel. Suffice it to say that Naughty Dog managed to make Joel, Ellie and many of the supporting characters feel surprisingly like real people, with their own problems and ambitions, instead of random stereotypes. This is storytelling at its absolute, unequivocal best.</p>

<p>Of course, when it comes to telling a compelling, believable story, it never hurts to have the best voice actors in the industry, and <em>The Last of Us</em> most definitely does. The amazing cast led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Baker">Troy Baker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Johnson">Ashley Johnson</a> deliver Oscar-worthy performances across the board, and help make this a truly unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>And last but certainly not least, there’s the wonderful <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us:_Left_Behind">Left Behind</a></em>, a roughly 3-hour-long DLC that was released about a year after the main game. <em>Left Behind</em> helped bridge a particular gap in the story of the main game, and also gave us a lot more insight into Ellie as a character. It not only further developed the story of <em>The Last of Us</em>, but it also gave us the opportunity to spend a few more precious hours in the company of these characters we’ve come to know so well. In my mind, it is quite possibly the best DLC ever, and it’s only fitting that it would put one heck of a finishing touch on such a remarkable game.</p>

<p><em>The Last of Us</em> will always be remembered as an excellent game, perhaps the crowning achievement of the previous generation of consoles. To me, however, it will go down as one of the most compelling and emotional stories I’ve ever experienced, and one of the most polished and inspired pieces of creative work I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at some of the week’s most interesting pieces of writing.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♢</p>


<h2>Top Five: The Panic sign, China’s twilight, Apple and podcasting, colorizing vintage photos, and being a whistleblower</h2>

<p>As usual, this week’s selection is strong, and varied. In no particular order:</p>

<h3><a href="https://panic.com/blog/the-panic-sign/">The Panic Sign | Cabel Sasser →</a></h3>

<p>Panic put up a new sign on their headquarters, and it went exactly as you’d expect. Brilliant.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♤</p>


<h3><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/chinas-twilight-years/480768/">China’s Twilight Years | Howard W. French →</a></h3>

<p>This was an interesting take on the social and economic issues that China is likely to face in the future. Some scary stuff in there, definitely.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♧</p>


<h3><a href="https://marco.org/2016/05/07/apple-role-in-podcasting">Apple’s actual role in podcasting: be careful what you wish for | Marco Arment →</a></h3>

<p>Marco shared his take on the recent rumors that Apple may be getting more closely involved with podcasting in the future. Lots of good points here, although Marco is definitely an interested party, so take them with a grain of salt. So am I, for that matter.</p>

<h3><a href="http://petapixel.com/2016/04/07/10-colorized-vintage-photos-famous-landmarks-built/">10 colorized vintage photos of famous landmarks being built | Michael Zhang →</a></h3>

<p>Your weird and oddly mesmerizing photography project of the week.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♢</p>


<h3><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/05/03/edward-snowden-whistleblowing-is-not-just-leaking-its-an-act-of-political-resistance/">Inside the Assassination Complex | Edward Snowden →</a></h3>

<p>Terrific piece by Edward Snowden on what being a whistleblower is really like:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the challenges of being a whistleblower is living with the knowledge that people continue to sit, just as you did, at those desks, in that unit, throughout the agency, who see what you saw and comply in silence, without resistance or complaint. They learn to live not just with untruths but with unnecessary untruths, dangerous untruths, corrosive untruths. It is a double tragedy: What begins as a survival strategy ends with the compromise of the human being it sought to preserve and the diminishing of the democracy meant to justify the sacrifice.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>It’s been an interesting week. I’d love to stay and write a proper farewell, but I’m afraid I left Nate hanging from a particularly steep cliff, so I’m just going to head back now and give him a hand.</p>

<p>Have a wonderful Sunday, and thank you for reading.</p>
