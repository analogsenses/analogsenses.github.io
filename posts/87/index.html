<p>Despite having ruined her own laptop, her sister’s laptop, and the library’s computers, not to mention Steven and Brian’s afternoon, she takes full credit for her game design– only to get extra credit and decide she’s an awesome computer engineer! “I did it all by myself!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Wait, there&rsquo;s more:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you hold the book in your hands to read a story, the opposite book is upside down, facing out. So the final insult to this entire literary disaster is that when you read “Barbie: I Can Be a Computer Engineer,” it appears that you are so fucking dumb, you’re reading “Barbie: I Can Be an Actress” upside down.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple today unveiled WatchKit, the set of development tools that will allow 3rd-party developers to build apps for the upcoming Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Underscore David Smith has <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/11/18/initial-impressions-for-watchkit/">a few interesting thoughts</a> about it (emphasis his):</p>

<blockquote><p>Rather than just saying we only get Glances and Notifications, we get to build <strong>actual, useful</strong> watch apps. Those apps, however, are architected in such a way as to make them extremely battery conscious. I suspect the biggest power draw these apps will have is the networking between the iPhone and Watch. However, optimizing the Watch OS for efficient networking is much easier than building an entire, rich SDK that is similarly respectful.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to say, I&rsquo;m pretty excited. The fact that WatchKit is already out means the Apple Watch will support native 3rd-party apps from day one, and that&rsquo;s great for everyone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>D. T. Max, National Geographic:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now consider the siesta. The timing of the traditional siesta corresponds to a natural post-lunch dip in our circadian rhythms, and studies have shown that people who catnap are generally more productive and may even enjoy lower risk of death from heart disease. It is the Spanish who have made the siesta famous. Unfortunately, Spaniards no longer live close enough to work to go home and nap. Instead some use the afternoon break to go out for long lunches with friends and colleagues. Having spent two hours at lunch, Spanish workers then cannot finish work until seven or eight. But even then they don’t always go home. They go out for drinks or dinner instead. (Go to a Spanish disco at midnight and you’re likely to be dancing alone; their prime-time TV shows are just ending.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Great article but seriously, who goes dancing before midnight?</p>

<blockquote><p>“It is impossible for you to do it,” he told her. “You are a woman and would need a protector.” Even if she could travel alone, he said, she’d want to take too much baggage. “There is no use talking about it,” he insisted. “No one but a man could do this.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said. “Start the man, and I’ll start the same day for some other newspaper and beat him.”</p>

<p>She was 24 when she said this. The next year, a few months after her 25th birthday, the paper said yes, and she set sail.</p>

<p>She brought one suitcase.</p></blockquote>

It&rsquo;s a nice review as usual, and I quite enjoyed it. They really liked the lens too, and they even gave it an Editor&rsquo;s Choice Award. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a wide-angle lens for the MFT system, it sure seems like a no-brainer. However, upon further consideration, there&rsquo;s a little bit more to it than that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the market for a wide-angle lens for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HPQ09H6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HPQ09H6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=F5UXK6NKDSRJZ63Y">Olympus OM-D E-M10</a> for a while, so naturally when this lens was announced it instantly became a front-runner in my list of candidates — alongside the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A7Q9U9Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00A7Q9U9Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=5FDZUXO3JEC5JSPW">Olympus M. Zuiko 17mm f/1.8</a> and the drop-dead-gorgeous-but-insanely-expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VHDUN4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007VHDUN4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=LUVSZOFZG5KOCGH2">Voigtlander Nokton 17.5mm f/0.95</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve had the time to think about it some more though, I&rsquo;m having mixed feelings about it. After months of experimenting with a 35mm wide-angle lens and my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_AE-1_Program">Canon AE-1 Program</a> I&rsquo;ve found out I really enjoy this focal length, and therein lies the problem with the Panasonic lens: it&rsquo;s neither here nor there when it comes to its focal length.</p>

<p>If you were to build a nice set of prime lenses, the standard focal lengths would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>12mm and 14mm:</strong> super-wide-angle (24mm and 28mm full-frame equivalent).</li>
<li><strong>17.5mm:</strong> moderate wide-angle (35mm full-frame equivalent).</li>
<li><strong>25mm:</strong> normal (50mm full-frame equivalent).</li>
<li><strong>42.5mm:</strong> portrait (85mm full-frame equivalent).</li>
</ul>


<p>As a starting point, these would be the first few bases to cover. There are longer and shorter lenses out there, of course, but those would be considered specialty lenses. The problem with the Panasonic lenses for MFT is that they sometimes disregard these lengths and instead use some slightly different, slightly awkward values.</p>

<p>Take the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJS830Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DJS830Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=PVUWNZJKFNVNQRRY">Panasonic 20mm f/1.7</a> pancake lens, for example. It&rsquo;s an amazing lens in every way, except its 20mm focal length lies awkwardly in the middle between a true normal lens (which would be 25mm in Micro Four Thirds terms, or 50mm in full-frame photography) and a standard wide-angle (17.5mm MFT or 35mm full-frame equivalent). It&rsquo;s a bit wider than a normal lens, but not really wide enough to be considered a proper wide-angle lens.</p>

<p>The new 15mm f/1.7 lens presents the same problem: it&rsquo;s wider than a typical wide-angle, but not quite as wide as a super-wide-angle (12mm/14mm MFT, or 24mm/18mm full-frame). This may not look like a big deal — it&rsquo;s admittedly nitpicking to a degree — but it does bother me a bit. When you&rsquo;re in wide-angle territory, every millimeter has a noticeable impact, more so than in the normal and portrait ranges. This is not to say that it&rsquo;s a bad lens, of course. Far from it. Actually, I might even be interested in it at some point in the future, just not before I&rsquo;ve completed my set of standard-length lenses.</p>

<p>I guess what bothers me the most is that I can&rsquo;t help but feel that these decisions were made solely for the sake of market differentiation. Using non-standard focal lengths makes the lenses instantly recognizable and unique but, does it actually make them <em>better?</em> Is there a significant improvement in quality to warrant their existence? Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>Of course, if Panasonic wants to experiment with slightly different focal lengths in their product lineup, they have every right to do so. There&rsquo;s certainly a reasonable case to be made for variety; it just strikes me as odd that they would do it <em>before</em> shipping a proper wide-angle lens for the system. And it <em>definitely</em> strikes me as odd in a Leica-branded lens.</p>

<p>The other Leica-branded primes for MFT — the legendary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055N2L22/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0055N2L22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=HAZK376KP2IZJFGB">Summilux 25mm f/1.4</a> and the even more impressive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HXE4GZQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HXE4GZQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=HNEXCNV7ZC2565VL">Nocticron 42.5mm f/1.2</a> — are both standard-length lenses and they&rsquo;ve received nothing but praise. Why mess with a successful philosophy and why now?<sup id="fnref:1-9"><a href="#fn:1-9" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The Leica name is supposed to stand for absolute excellence and tradition. I would love nothing more than a true 17.5mm Summilux lens for Micro Four Thirds but alas, such a lens does not exist yet. And that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>

<p>I keep going over it in my head and the more I think about it, the more I&rsquo;m leaning towards <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VHDUN4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007VHDUN4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=LUVSZOFZG5KOCGH2">the Voigtlander</a>. It&rsquo;s built like a tank, it&rsquo;s <em>crazy</em> fast, sharp wide-open and its image quality and color rendering <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/1920748@N23/">are amazing</a>. I also love that it&rsquo;s manual-focus only and the dedicated aperture control ring. It&rsquo;s already a classic lens for the MFT system, and deservedly so. Too bad it&rsquo;s so damn pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. If you like fully-manual lenses akin to those for the Leica M-System, the Voigtlander is hard to beat.<sup id="fnref:2-9"><a href="#fn:2-9" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>However, as amazing as the Voigtlander is, it boggles the mind to think that in November of 2014, there&rsquo;s still not a single 17.5mm autofocus lens available for Micro Four Thirds cameras. The closest one is the aforementioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A7Q9U9Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00A7Q9U9Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=5FDZUXO3JEC5JSPW">Olympus 17mm f/1.8</a> — which, admittedly, is a really good lens and it&rsquo;s close enough for the difference in focal length to be negligible. If you absolutely must have autofocus, this is your only choice. If you can live without it though, my advice would be to pick up the Voigtlander instead.</p>

<p>The Olympus is a solid lens but it was released in 2012, two full years ago already. In that time, this 15mm f/1.7 lens is the closest Panasonic has come to the standard wide-angle length. For a system that&rsquo;s exploded in popularity over the past few years, that&rsquo;s not enough.</p>

<p>The 35mm full-frame equivalent is one of the most important focal lengths in everyday use: it&rsquo;s remarkably versatile and it&rsquo;s perfect for street photography, among other things. It&rsquo;s a shame that, after several years of exceptional lens releases, this essential focal length remains so poorly represented — relatively speaking, of course — in the Micro Four Thirds system.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m aware that there&rsquo;s another Leica lens with a non-standard focal length: the older <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NKM29C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002NKM29C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=FANISKAPYWPPD2FZ">Elmarit 45mm f/2.8</a>. However, it is by far the least popular of them and has effectively been rendered irrelevant by the Nocticron.<a href="#fnref:1-9" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2-9">
<p>The only real drawback here — other than the price — is the lack of electrical contacts. This means there&rsquo;s no information about the aperture being relayed to the camera&rsquo;s metering system to calculate the exposure parameters. Instead, these parameters need to be set manually. If you shoot in manual mode most of the time, then this is no big deal. If, on the other hand, you rely on the camera to do it for you, then the Voigtlander lenses may not be the best choice.<a href="#fnref:2-9" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
