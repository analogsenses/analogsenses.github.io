  <div class="entry-content"><p>Terrific essay by Matt Gemmell, and a scathing critique of Pope Benedict XVI&rsquo;s <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/01/09/uk-pope-gay-idUKTRE8081RR20120109">recent declarations against gay marriage</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The idea that a consensual relationship, between adults of sound mind, could be somehow immoral is itself repugnant. If the charge of immorality arises from nothing but the sexual orientation of those people, we must upgrade that judgement to literally criminal.

To even make the association, much less to openly invite others to adopt it, is bigotry - and to create or perpetuate a system where such people’s actual rights are negatively affected, is another thing that religion has long and rightly been accused of: persecution.

I find it quite impossible to understand how an ethical, enlightened person can read His Holiness’ appalling, scurrilous and slanderous statement without repugnance. I also strongly doubt the character, moral fibre, and critical faculties of any person who would defend it.</blockquote>


<p>More than criticizing the Pope&rsquo;s views, Matt is reflecting on religion itself, be it Catholic or otherwise. So much of what he so skillfully says resonates with my own views on the topic, so much of it <em>feels</em> right, that I cannot help but beg you to read it in full.</p>

<blockquote>The legacy of religion is not peace, or morality, or comfort. It is war, and terror, and persecution. The legacy of religion is the Crusades, and tent-revivalist preachers stealing from the poor, and Afghan women who can be imprisoned for being a victim of rape, and can then be murdered by their own families if they will not then marry their rapists.

Such a legacy is clearly subhuman, and part of humanity’s fading childhood. It is to be discarded, after it has been fought to extinction. As a thinking, enlightened, rational person, I’m compelled to be its enemy.</blockquote>


<p>Thank you so much for writing this, Matt.</p>

<blockquote>Introducing, Allthis.com. They list themselves as being in “beta” on their website and claim to be “the ten-minute exchange”. Apparently users can bid on and purchase blocks of other users’ time! How exciting!</blockquote>


<p>Apparently there are still plenty of douchebags getting funded on the Internet to do bad things to other people. Enter AllThis, the newest-but-already-pretty-fucked-up startup that decided it would be a great idea to steal the profile pictures and info from some of the most followed and respected tech writers on the Internet in order to make it look like they&rsquo;re using their service. Which, of course, they&rsquo;re not.</p>

<p>Also, they&rsquo;ll happily sell you 10 minutes of these people&rsquo;s time. And they don&rsquo;t even need to own it, that&rsquo;s just how they roll.</p>

<p>This is despicable. Fortunately, they messed with the wrong guys. You see, Marco Arment, Mike Monteiro, Andy Ihnatko&hellip; These are not only nice and knowledgeable guys, they also know how to deal with Internet thieves. Unfortunately for them, they&rsquo;ve had some practice before.</p>

<p>Also worth checking out: The much better, much more honest and much more close to reality (and also much less official and I&rsquo;m guessing pretty soon to be removed) <a href="https://twitter.com/allthisPR">AllThisPR </a>Twitter account. You gotta love the Internet for giving us things like these.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a day much like today in 1915, Frank Sinatra was born. Here&rsquo;s a small playlist for today with my favorite songs. Play it to yourself, relax and enjoy his gentle, soothing voice. Play it at work, play it on your way home, or play it to your significant other. Better yet, to your future significant other. This is romance the way it should be. Simply put, nobody makes music like this anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/6499744773/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7008/6499744773_68e6ea062e.jpg" alt="Frank Sinatra" /></a></p>

<p>Frank Sinatra was a man of his time. He enjoyed each and every day as if it were his last. He was just as proud of his failures (and there were quite a few) as he was of his successes, and he really went through life with a cavalier attitude until the end, maybe like no one else has.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to your very good health, sir. You are still, as always, very sorely missed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was skimming through my Twitter feed when I found <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgemmell/status/144775455642370048">this gem</a> in Matt Gemmel&rsquo;s timeline. The developers of the shoot-em-up game Serious Sam 3 have embedded a great way to discourage piracy in the game: <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/serious-sam-3s-drm-giant-invincible-scorpion">a giant, immortal, pink scorpion</a> that relentlessly mauls you to death as soon as the game starts, but of course only on illegally obtained copies of the game.</p>

<p>Which in turn led me to the aforelinked piece by Brian Howe about DRM. The real, hardcore DRM, mind you:</p>

<blockquote>Standing five metres high, covered in dense hair and ropy muscle, our Digital Rights Minotaurs are eternally vigilant deterrents against product use. Where did we find them? Don’t ask. These mythical beasts never seem to eat or sleep, and we’ve got a crapload of them. There’s probably one grunting softly outside your cubicle right now, waiting. Since we agree that hand loss is a fair penalty for attempted gaming, it hardly needs to be said that going so far as to make a backup copy for personal use results in an instant deathblow.</blockquote>


<p>The entire piece is filled with rage-inducing awesomeness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been known to happen before. Also, despite my best efforts, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it will happen again. It&rsquo;s three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, I&rsquo;m riding the subway, and I&rsquo;m running late. I need to make a connection to another line in order to get to the train station, where the train that&rsquo;s supposed to take me to my home town for a few days is set to leave in just a few minutes. If I&rsquo;m going to make it, I&rsquo;ll need to get lucky. It&rsquo;s the last train of the day and there&rsquo;s no room for error.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m nervous, and I&rsquo;m cursing myself for not having left work a bit earlier. It&rsquo;s always like that, I know, but in that moment I swear it will never happen again. As the subway starts to slow down my body becomes tense and I tickle with anticipation. Just as we stop, I can see the other train arriving on the opposite side of the platform. I need to get there and I only have a few seconds. I don&rsquo;t think, and I don&rsquo;t hesitate. There&rsquo;s no time for that.</p>

<p>On the floor by my side is my trusty GR2, holding enough clothes for a week. I grab it hard and I pull and, just as the doors of my wagon slide open, I swing it over my shoulders with a quick gesture. A fraction of a second later, I&rsquo;m sprinting up a set of escalators, across the wide hallway and down another set of escalators. It all happens very quickly, and I blaze past everyone around me. Throughout the whole thing, my GR2 stays with me. I don&rsquo;t feel it moving on my back, and I&rsquo;m not slowed down by its weight. With a last but demanding effort, I jump into the other wagon just as the doors are beginning to close.</p>

<p>My heart is racing, I&rsquo;m breathing hard, and I&rsquo;m sweating profusely, but I&rsquo;m also smiling. I&rsquo;ve made it. Now I know I will get to the station in time for my train. I sit down and wipe the sweat off my forehead. About a minute later, I&rsquo;m already wondering which songs to play on my iPhone on the way home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m light, and I&rsquo;m fast. But more importantly, I&rsquo;m on my train, and off to some well deserved holidays.</p>

<p>Now, try doing that with a trolley or a big suitcase.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too.

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise.

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same.

If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools.

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss.

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much.

If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</blockquote>


<p>Words to live by.</p>

<p>Two lines from this poem (<em>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / And treat those two impostors just the same</em>) are featured on the player&rsquo;s entrance to Centre Court in Wimbledon. Here&rsquo;s a video featuring none other than Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal reading a few lines prior to their classic Wimbledon 2008 final.</p>

<p>Sport can be cruel sometimes. We&rsquo;ve all seen athletes hurt, cry, vomit, pass out and even bleed on their way to victory. When your legs give up, your spirit is the only thing that keeps you going, pushing your body through that extra mile. Being an athlete requires you to be able to handle defeat frequently, often brutally. It requires you to never give up, to believe in yourself. To lift yourself up after a tough loss, dust yourself off and start working hard again. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you may have a chance to fight another day.</p>

<p><em>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster&hellip;</em> It&rsquo;s difficult to find two other lines with so much meaning.</p>

<p>This was the 200th post on Analog Senses. I thought it was appropriate to dedicate it to something that&rsquo;s important to me. I don&rsquo;t know what it will mean to you. It may serve as a reminder. Or maybe as a motivation. Or perhaps, if I&rsquo;m lucky, it may stir something inside you that you didn&rsquo;t know was there.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all athletes in our lives in one way or another. And we all need to work hard, stay strong, and learn to accept that, though on any given day we may lose, what we should never accept is defeat.</p>
