  <div class="entry-content"><p>And this, my friends, is why I love movies. A fun teaser:</p>

<blockquote>“In comes Sam with a burger in his hand and a drink in the other hand and stinking like fast food,” says Richard Gladstein. “Me and Quentin and Lawrence were sitting on the couch, and he walked in and just started sipping that shake and biting that burger and looking at all of us. I was scared shitless. I thought that this guy was going to shoot a gun right through my head. His eyes were popping out of his head. And he just stole the part.” Lawrence Bender adds, “He was the guy you see in the movie. He said, ‘Do you think you’re going to give this part to somebody else? I’m going to blow you motherfuckers away.’ ”</blockquote>

<p>This is a great article. Social networks are chock-full of people who love telling you what you should write (and specially NOT write) about. I like where Matt stands: My house, my rules. If you don&rsquo;t like what you see, you&rsquo;re free to leave. Just don&rsquo;t bother telling me about it: I simply do not care.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wonderful article, and so true. I&rsquo;ve always felt strongly about this: the items you buy should always be the very best you can get. Period.</p>

<blockquote>An interesting side effect, which I hadn’t anticipated, was that I developed a blind trust in the things I used. I trusted my lamp to be bright enough to light up the wheel well of a truck when its tire went flat, and it was. I trusted my wallet to hold cash, boarding passes, and IDs without deforming or falling apart, and it did. I trusted that my towel would dry quickly, because it was designed for travel, and it did. I trusted the zippers on my backpack to stay closed as I hiked through the night, and they did. These might seem like stupid things to worry about, but when you have trust in everything you own, you don’t have to worry about anything. It’s liberating and an amazing feeling. My life was markedly better because of it.</blockquote>


<p>I will always choose quality over quantity. That means owning less stuff, which by the way is a bonus. I&rsquo;ll have fewer items, meaning less clutter in my life, and the items I do get to have will always be top-notch. That&rsquo;s why I have my GORUCK rucks, my Bianchi bicycle, my iPhone, you name it. It&rsquo;s also why I&rsquo;ve spent the last three weeks (and counting) researching <a href="http://www.bikeforums.net/showthread.php/222654-Kurt-Kinetic-Road-Machine-vs-1UP-Trainer-Review">indoor bike trainers</a>, as opposed to just buying a cheap one in my local bike shop. I want to make absolutely sure that the one I end up buying is really <a href="http://www.kurtkinetic.com/road-machine-p-198-l-en.html">the best for me</a>. Would a cheaper one get the job done? Probably. Would it have the same feel, robustness, and <a href="http://www.kurtkinetic.com/lifetime_warranty.php">customer service?</a> Would it see me through 10, 15 or even more winters and still perform flawlessly? I doubt it.</p>

<p>Sure, it takes time and effort, and it&rsquo;s usually more expensive up front to buy things this way. But it&rsquo;s worth it, no doubt about it. Great things are built to last and if you choose carefully, most of the stuff you own should easily outlast you. They are <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/2010/11/05/final-choices/">final choices</a>. That&rsquo;s the code I live by. It gives me peace of mind, knowing I can rely on my things when I really need to. Knowing that they&rsquo;ll always have my back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marco Arment, on the &ldquo;Individual Tweet&rdquo; section of Twitter&rsquo;s <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-guidelines">Display Guidelines</a>, which will become Requirements in the near future:</p>

<blockquote>Embedding tweets in a blog post in any way other than their dynamic embed code is effectively prohibited.</blockquote>


<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>I’m pretty sure this means that I can’t just display a tweet as a link and blockquote when I want to quote it here.</blockquote>


<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s accurate. Guidelines are one thing, they apply to everyone, but <em>Requirements</em> are a different matter entirely. This is the Internet. Twitter may force these requirements upon developers who need access to their API. That&rsquo;s their leverage. But the rest of the Internet doesn&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s ass about Twitter&rsquo;s requirements, and why should they? Individual tweets have public URL&rsquo;s just like every other webpage. How we decide to link to these pages on our personal sites is nobody&rsquo;s business but our own.</p>

<p>I suppose the one thing they could do is block incoming links from sites that don&rsquo;t follow the requirements, but I doubt they&rsquo;ll ever dare to do such a thing. For all their tough talk, Twitter needs the Internet more than the Internet needs Twitter.</p>

<p>So, Twitter. Thanks for the guidelines, but I&rsquo;ll pass. As long as tweets are accessible via public URL&rsquo;s, I will link to them however I want. If that changes one day, I&rsquo;m not sure I would see much of a point in using Twitter anymore. In any case, I assure you, you will not see any of that embedded crap on this website anytime soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the wake of <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">Twitter&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;Fuck You&rdquo;</a> to third-party developers, <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/">Ben Brooks points out</a> this nice article form Garrett Murray about the origin of the @reply syntax that has now become standard practice across many places on the Internet:</p>

<blockquote>I have always half-jokingly taken credit for inventing the @reply on Twitter. Or at least for starting its wide-spread use on Twitter—I got the idea from seeing people do it over at Flickr, where it had been happening for more than a year. But until today I continued to claim I was the first person to do it on Twitter.</blockquote>


<p>Funnily enough, as many have pointed out, the main reason Twitter has grown so dramatically in the last few years is its incredibly active and engaging user base. They made Twitter into what it is today by coming up with the most compelling features and pushing them so hard that they ended up being officially integrated into the service.</p>

<p>Twitter is a unique service in that it&rsquo;s a network largely built and shaped by its users. It still is, despite the recent changes, but they need to be extremely careful moving forward or they risk alienating the very same users that made them relevant in the first place.</p>

<p>Call me crazy, but I&rsquo;d argue that if Twitter wants to keep thriving, screwing with its developer community is not the smartest way to go about it.</p>
