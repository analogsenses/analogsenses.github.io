  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, among other announcements, Apple introduced the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air-2/">iPad Air 2</a>, the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini-3/">iPad mini 3</a> and upgraded the long-neglected <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>. However, the real star of the show was the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/">iMac with Retina 5K display</a>. What an incredible machine.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go over each of the new hardware announcements in a bit more detail.</p>

<h2>The new iPads</h2>

<p>Last year, Apple upgraded the iPad mini and gave it the same internals as the then-flagship iPad Air. Actually, both machines were so similar that it didn&rsquo;t really make sense to call one of them the flagship. They were, for all practical purposes, the same device in two different sizes.<sup id="fnref:1-8"><a href="#fn:1-8" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This time around, though, things have changed.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3931/15371042348_d767eea2d7_o.png"/></p>




<p class="photo-credit">(iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. Photo: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/">Apple</a>)</p>


<p>The iPad Air 2 is a typical year-over-year upgrade from Apple: it is thinner, a bit lighter, it has Touch ID, a much better camera and it&rsquo;s powered by a faster chip.<sup id="fnref:2-8"><a href="#fn:2-8" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It also got a new laminated display and an anti-reflective coating, which should slightly improve the viewing experience, particularly in brightly lit places.</p>

<p>All in all, the iPad Air 2 is a nice upgrade that should make an already excellent device even more enjoyable to use. It&rsquo;s not a dramatic improvement over the first-generation iPad Air, though. After all, the Air was already thin enough for most people, myself included. I&rsquo;ve owned an iPad Air for over 6 months, and not once did I look at it and say to myself: &ldquo;Gee, I love my iPad, if only it were a bit thinner it would be perfect&rdquo;. If you already have an Air, I honestly see no compelling reason to upgrade, other than you can spare the money. Anything older, though, and the upgrade is much more compelling.</p>

<p>As a side note, it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder every year to get excited about a thinner and lighter version of what is essentially the same product. That could be a factor in the sales slump the iPad has suffered this past year. The typical refresh cycle for a tablet seems to be significantly longer than for a phone; 2 or 3-year-old iPads are still being happily used and enjoyed by their owners, who probably don&rsquo;t feel the same pressure to upgrade as they do with their iPhones. Not to mention that carrier subsidies contribute quite a bit to the phone-upgrade frenzy — spending $200 on a new phone every couple years is much easier to digest than buying a $600 tablet to replace the perfectly good one you already have.</p>

<p>The iPad mini 3 is a very different story, though. If you didn&rsquo;t buy one last year thinking that this year&rsquo;s version would be the one to get&hellip; well, you were wrong. Sorry about that. Apple took last year&rsquo;s iPad mini with a Retina Display — now retroactively called iPad mini 2 — added Touch ID, a gold color option and called it a day. The iPad mini 3 is still powered by the same A7 chip as last year&rsquo;s model, it&rsquo;s just as thin and light — which, to be fair, is not bad at all — and judging from a picture in <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-now-taking-pre-orders-ipad-mini-3-ipad-air-2">this article on iMore</a>, it still has the same narrower color gamut display.</p>

<p>If Apple had replaced the iPad mini 2 with the 3 while maintaining the price, people wouldn&rsquo;t have much reason to be excited, but the 3 would still make sense as a product. However, Apple decided to keep the iPad mini 2 in the lineup and dropped the price by a hundred bucks. Call me crazy but at $299, the iPad mini 2 seems like a far better deal. Touch ID and a gold color choice, while nice things to have, are not worth $100, in my opinion.</p>

<p>My advice if you&rsquo;re considering buying the entry-level, $399 iPad mini 3, is to get the $349 32GB iPad mini 2 instead. It&rsquo;s just a better use of your money: you get twice the storage capacity and you get to save 50 bucks. However, if you do need 64 GB of storage — and many people do — your only option is the iPad mini 3.</p>

<p>Oh, and Apple also decided to keep the original iPad mini and sell it for $249. I can&rsquo;t even begin to understand why someone would buy it over the iPad mini 2, but there it is. Make of it what you will.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of the iPad mini form factor, the worst part of yesterday&rsquo;s event is that Apple all but confirmed its role as a second-class citizen in the iPad lineup. Last year&rsquo;s refresh now seems like a fluke, and we are left to think that the mini will probably remain one generation behind the Air for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>The upgraded Mac Mini</h2>

<p>Not much to say here, other than the obvious. The Mac mini got a decent upgrade with faster processors and a new starting price of $499. After two years without being upgraded, the smallest member of the Mac family is once again an attractive entry-level option into the OS X ecosystem. Not bad.</p>

<p class="photo-credit">(Mac mini. Photo: <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Apple</a>)</p>


<h2>The iMac with Retina 5K display</h2>

<p>This is the computer we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for ever since we saw our first Retina display. For some, that goes as back as the iPhone 4 — for me personally, it was the 4S. It&rsquo;s such a striking difference that you must see it with your own eyes to really believe it. However, even though Apple has been relentlessly pushing display technology forward for years, a true desktop Retina experience remained elusive, until now.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5602/15557182885_a1e7a8be91_o.png"/></p>




<p class="photo-credit">(iMac with Retina 5K display. Photo: <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/">Apple</a>)</p>


<p>I have to say, I&rsquo;m impressed they could pull it off, and at this price: $2499 for that display alone would be a bargain. Considering it comes with a pretty good computer inside, it feels unreal. Granted, it&rsquo;s still a lot of money, but if you&rsquo;ve ever stared at a Retina display, you know it&rsquo;s worth every penny. I can&rsquo;t wait to see one of these in person.</p>

<p>iMacs are extraordinarily resilient machines. Mine is from early 2008 and it&rsquo;s still in perfect working condition. It&rsquo;s an investment you&rsquo;ll never regret.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Apple event wasn&rsquo;t particularly exciting or jam-packed with incredible announcements, but it marked another step forward for Apple and the maturity of their ecosystem. We&rsquo;ve finally come to a point where all Apple devices are able to seamlessly communicate and work with each other. From the outside this may look deceptively easy, but it&rsquo;s the result of many years&#8217; worth of work. It&rsquo;s a cheesy line, I&rsquo;ll admit, but it&rsquo;s absolutely true that only Apple could create an experience as cohesive and solid as this, and we&rsquo;re only just beginning to realize its potential.</p>

<p>Whether you own a Mac or an iOS device — or both — this is a great time to be an Apple user.</p>

From an attachment POV, my bike is number one by a mile.</p>

<p>I’m attached. The reason is this…it represents a story and a process. Allow me to share the story (it does have a point).</p></blockquote>

<p>I totally get where she&rsquo;s coming from. There&rsquo;s something special about an object with a past life going back decades. It&rsquo;s a feeling you won&rsquo;t find on a new bicycle, no matter how much you spend. Classic road bikes from the 70&rsquo;s or so are incredible feats of craftsmanship. Those things were built to last a lifetime, and many of them are still actively being used every day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d much prefer to put $500 towards restoring a classic, handmade italian frame than spending them on a new bike.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/8611214608/">I actually did</a>. But that&rsquo;s a story for another day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marco has an excellent and thorough article on the differences between both models:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/">5K Retina iMac</a> is out, and it looks incredible so far on paper — so incredible that I’m seriously considering selling my new Mac Pro to get the Retina iMac instead. In fact, the case for the Mac Pro for anyone but advanced video editors, 3D modelers, and heavy OpenCL users is now weaker than ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always found the iMac to be a near perfect computer but now it&rsquo;s getting ridiculous. Even the completely redesigned Mac Pro compares poorly, particularly considering it won&rsquo;t be getting an external Retina display anytime soon:</p>

<blockquote><p>It may be possible to use two Thunderbolt 2 cables to power a 5K display, but only if the GPU could treat each port as its own full-bandwidth DisplayPort 1.2 channel, the sum of which represented one logical display, and had the panel using something like MST to combine the two at the other end. But the only Mac with more than one Thunderbolt bus (not port) is the current Mac Pro, and I can’t see today’s Apple shipping an external display that none of their laptops can use.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a high-end desktop computer, the Retina iMac looks like a no-brainer.</p>

<blockquote><p>Let’s step through that one again. People will forsake their Mac Pros for this iMac, until there comes a day when a screen like this is available as an external display option for the Mac Pro. For $2500 or less. People who would never have considered buying an iMac will buy this iMac.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to say, I agree. I haven&rsquo;t even seen this iMac yet, and I already want it. <a href="http://www.analogsenses.com/2014/05/21/upgrading-my-early-2008-24-imac-to-an-ssd/">A few months ago</a> I said I probably wouldn&rsquo;t replace my current iMac — a 24-inch Early 2008 model — until it died on me, but an iMac with a Retina display is a whole different animal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/522718738962202624">Federico Viticci</a> and <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2014/10/apple-to-temporarily-pull-blood-glucose-measurement-from-health-app">Stephen Hackett</a> today pointed out that <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT6533">Apple is temporarily pulling support for blood glucose measurements</a> from the Health app. I know it sounds serious, but here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s probably not a big deal.</p>

<p>The truth is, blood glucose measurement support in the Health app is ridiculously rudimentary as it is, even if it worked properly. A typical person with diabetes needs to monitor their blood sugar levels anywhere from 3 to 10 times a day, sometimes even more (you need to take additional tests in case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</a>, which is a fairly common event). There&rsquo;s no way a significant portion of those people are going to take the extra effort to manually log each and every measurement in the Health app. I know I don&rsquo;t, and if this feature has failed to encourage <em>me</em> — an Apple enthusiast and technologically savvy young man — to use it, its chances of convincing regular users are pretty slim.</p>

<p>Blood glucose tracking in the Health app, at least in its current incarnation, is an irrelevant feature, because all diabetics already have a device that can do that for them: the very glucose meter they use to take the measurement in the first place. All glucose meters have a built-in memory to store the user&rsquo;s history, and virtually all of them offer ways to export and/or visualize that data.</p>

<p>The ability to manually log blood glucose measurements on an iPhone app is a complementary feature, for example in case you forget your glucose meter and need to borrow another device (I&rsquo;ve tested my levels using my father&rsquo;s glucose meter occasionally). It&rsquo;s nice to have it, but it&rsquo;s by no means an essential or particularly compelling feature.</p>

<p>As a central repository of data, the Health app makes sense, but it will only be really useful for diabetics if one of these things happen first:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Either Apple implements support for automatic data transfer between the Health app and several commercially available blood glucose meters (ideally the most popular ones), or&hellip;</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip;3rd-party apps implement this support <em>and</em> share the blood glucose data with the Health app. In this case, though, the Health app becomes redundant because the 3rd-party app would surely support some sort of data visualization features itself. It would also be unlikely, because due to the medical nature of this data (and hence, its confidentiality), I&rsquo;m not sure a 3rd-party developer would be legally able — let alone inclined — to share that data with anyone.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The blood glucose feature in the Health app, as it stands today, is merely an afterthought on Apple&rsquo;s part. This bug itself is proof of that: failing to consider both mg/dL and mmol/L as valid units is not just an oversight, it&rsquo;s one of the very first things a developer has to deal with — and one of the most important ones — when designing a diabetes-related app. The fact that they didn&rsquo;t clearly shows that it&rsquo;s not a priority for them.</p>

<p>In the end, the only sensible thing they could do is pull the feature. It&rsquo;s much better to not have a feature, than to have a poorly implemented version of one, particularly in an app as important as Health. I hope they take their time to fix it and bring it back with the support it deserves, because otherwise it will continue to be irrelevant to most diabetics. And that would be a shame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a <a href="/2014/10/09/the-finer-things-in-life-a-geeks-introduction-to-scotch">brief introduction to single malt Scotch whisky</a>, this is where the fun begins. For my first ever single malt tasting, I have selected none other than the best-selling single malt in the world: <a href="http://www.glenfiddich.com/us/collection/product-collection/core-range/12-year-old/">Glenfiddich 12 Year Old</a>.</p>

<h2>Master of Malt</h2>

<p>Before I begin, though, I&rsquo;d like to say a quick word about <a href="http://www.masterofmalt.com">Master of Malt</a>. When I decided to embark upon this journey, I knew I would need a way to procure several whiskies that are pretty difficult to find here in Madrid. Furthermore, since they were only for tasting purposes, I wanted to be able to buy them in small quantities. Scotch whisky can get pretty expensive surprisingly quickly, and I wasn&rsquo;t exactly looking forward to investing hundreds of dollars in bottles I&rsquo;m not yet able to appreciate anyway.</p>

<p>Luckily, the fine folks at Master of Malt solved all of these issues with ease. They sell <a href="http://www.masterofmalt.com/samples/">drinks by the dram</a>, which are beautifully bottled in miniature, 3 cl bottles and then sealed with wax. They&rsquo;re pretty affordable too, with a typical dram going for about 4-6 bucks, so I ordered every whisky on my tasting list from them. All in all, I ordered eleven premium drams and my order still came in at less than $100, shipping included. Talk about a no-brainer.</p>

<p>I received my order in only two working days, neatly packaged in three separate cardboard containers:</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5603/14921739523_77e10d387a_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>Inside each container there&rsquo;s room for up to five drams. Since I had ordered eleven drams, they came divided in groups of four, four and three.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3944/15518274746_4b57f656db_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>I love the wax seals, they add a touch of luxury while preserving the full aroma of the whisky. This is attention to detail where it matters, not just for show, and it&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5612/15356380190_7fb974b9d8_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>Besides, each dram is identified with a beautifully designed label that contains all the necessary information, including the name of the whisky and its alcoholic content.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5612/14921818943_03f8d27202_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>All this to say, I&rsquo;m extremely happy with Master of Malt. Their impressive selection and fast, reliable shipping will allow me to explore the world of single malt whisky for years to come, all without breaking the bank in the process. I really couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better solution.</p>

<p>And now without further ado, let&rsquo;s get down to business.</p>

<h2>The Glenfiddich name</h2>

<p>The Glenfiddich distillery <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenfiddich">was founded</a> by William Grant in 1886 and is still one of the very few privately owned distilleries in all of Scotland. It is currently managed by the fifth generation of William Grant&rsquo;s descendants. Glenfiddich means &ldquo;Valley of the Deer&rdquo; in Gaelic, where the distillery has been located since its foundation.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/karstenmay/5611140769"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5030/5611140769_56ce4c6620_b.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Glenfiddich produces all of its whisky on site, using water from the Robbie Dhu springs, and it&rsquo;s the only distillery in the world that produces all of its whisky from a single source of fresh water.</p>

<p>The iconic triangular bottle, designed by Hans Schleger, has been associated with the Glenfiddich brand ever since its introduction in 1957.</p>

<h2>Glenfiddich 12 Year Old</h2>

<p>The younger expression from Glenfiddich&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.glenfiddich.com/us/collection/product-collection/core-range/">core range</a>, Glenfiddich 12 Year Old is matured using American bourbon and Spanish sherry oak casks for at least 12 years.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3954/15485657672_77a68298cc_o.jpg"/></p>


<p>I would describe this whisky&rsquo;s color as yellow, with golden tones shining through. On <a href="http://www.glenfiddich.com/us/collection/product-collection/core-range/12-year-old/">the official product website</a>, it is described as &ldquo;golden&rdquo;. Using this color chart from <a href="http://www.whiskymag.com">Whisky Magazine</a>, I would say that Glenfiddich 12 lies somewhere between 0.6 (old gold) and 0.8 (deep gold). Click on the image to view it full-size.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/15541294995/"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3938/15541294995_3fd02f3bb8_o.jpg"/></a></p>


<p>For reference, here&rsquo;s a comparison shot between <a href="https://glenmorangie.com/en/glenmorangie-the-original">Glenmorangie The Original 10 Year Old</a> (0.2-0.3), Glenfiddich 12 Year Old and <a href="https://glenmorangie.com/en/glenmorangie-quinta-ruban">Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 12 Year Old</a> (1.4-1.5). The color difference is even more apparent in real life.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3949/15356568670_32612de019_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>Under normal circumstances, there is much to be learned about a whisky from its color alone. The type of casks used, the length of maturation and many other interesting details all manage to show up in its final appearance. Unfortunately, many houses today use caramel coloring (E150) to tweak the color of their whisky, including Glenfiddich. As such, there&rsquo;s not much more I can say about it without incurring in wild speculation.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount of controversy in the industry about whether common practices like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill_filtering">chill-filtering</a> or coloring affect the final taste of the whisky in a meaningful way. Some blind tasting experiments <a href="http://www.markbylok.com/blog/2014/9/18/single-malt-scotch-and-chill-filtration">suggest that they do not</a>, but the matter is far from settled.</p>

<p>For a company like Glenfiddich, that ships millions of bottles a year, these are necessary evils to guarantee the consistency of their brand. From that perspective, smaller distilleries can afford to be more respectful of the traditional process, with small variations across different bottlings serving as proof of their uniqueness. These smaller houses have found great success within the purist community, and are becoming more entrenched in their ways as they find a viable business. At the end of the day, though, these are different markets and it&rsquo;s normal to have different companies using different approaches to market their products.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5607/15539406711_6430b4dee8_h.jpg"/></p>


<h2>The nose</h2>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.allthingswhisky.com/?p=1030">All Things Whisky</a>, the nose of the Glenfiddich 12 can be described as gentle:</p>

<blockquote><p>You can safely stick your beak right into the glass without eyes watering, and pull in a deep breath.  The rewards are sweet fruit and light spice.  Apple and chunky pear.  Perhaps vanilla.  Something refreshing there as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>I most certainly agree. It&rsquo;s easy on the nose, not nearly as overpowering as other whiskies I&rsquo;ve tried. Though I&rsquo;m not picking up nearly as many details, the pear is quite evident, and I can also identify some vanilla undertones. However, this is not a whisky that grabs your attention and doesn&rsquo;t let go. Quite the contrary, in fact. While it doesn&rsquo;t send you on a trip down memory lane, it is perfectly pleasant. I would characterize it as well-rounded, and balanced. Adding a few drops of water opens it up quite a bit and makes it much more enjoyable, in my opinion.</p>

<h2>The palate</h2>

<p>Again, All Things Whisky:</p>

<blockquote><p>The simplicity of development is the biggest charm here, I believe.  Arrival is sweet and fruity.  A little bit of spice and creamy vanilla.  A little woody.  This isn’t one that unravels slowly and allows you to pull strands of flavor out individually, instead it is a nicely layered whisky that gives it all to you at once.  I have read of others picking out hints of peat and nut, but…not really seeing it.  The finish is pleasantly long, and the aftertaste mild.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a straightforward drink that doesn&rsquo;t play games. While it does get easier on my tongue towards the bottom of the glass, its taste doesn&rsquo;t evolve beyond that initial impression at any point. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why it didn&rsquo;t really sweep me off my feet, despite having been drinking it for the better part of a week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give them this, though: its consistency is remarkable. I&rsquo;ve tried several different bottles; I&rsquo;ve tried it early in the evening, late at night and even one morning that I was feeling particularly brave, and it was always exactly the same. In a way, Glenfiddich 12 is like that old friend we all have: you may not have seen him in a long time but when you do, all it takes is five minutes with him to send you right back.</p>

<p>I could see myself coming back to this whisky every now and then, whenever I feel nostalgic and want a familiar taste. That&rsquo;s well within my character, and I imagine I&rsquo;m not alone.</p>

<h2>The finish</h2>

<p>I would say it&rsquo;s medium, or medium-long. It stays with you effortlessly between sips, just long enough for a relaxed drinking session. It will not linger on for hours after you&rsquo;re done, though.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3934/15518401556_46e48733d6_h.jpg"/></p>


<h2>Perfect for</h2>

<p>Any and all situations where the drink is not the focus of your attention. If you&rsquo;re watching an episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/">Mad Men</a> after a long day, pour yourself a glass and sit closer to the TV. If you&rsquo;re having drinks with your friends, this is something that won&rsquo;t distract you from an interesting conversation, but also won&rsquo;t diminish your enjoyment of it in any way.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another situation where this whisky excels. Glenfiddich 12 is almost the perfect drink to order when you&rsquo;re on a trip far away from home:<sup id="fnref:1-20"><a href="#fn:1-20" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> it never fails, and if they only stock one single malt at a bar, chances are it&rsquo;s going to be this one. Think of it as a landmark that can give you a sense of firm ground when you&rsquo;re surrounded by the unknown. An anchor. I know I&rsquo;ve needed that sometimes.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5614/15299118249_4139eeff00_o.jpg"/></p>


<h2>Overall impression</h2>

<p>You can go to McDonald&rsquo;s pretty much anywhere in the world and I can guarantee you that their hamburgers will taste exactly the same. And when people go to McDonald&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not because they want the best hamburger; it&rsquo;s because they want a McDonald&rsquo;s hamburger. Businesses like McDonald&rsquo;s thrive not because they&rsquo;re the best, but because they are extremely consistent. The familiar has a powerful pull, and that&rsquo;s the angle Glenfiddich is playing.<sup id="fnref:2-20"><a href="#fn:2-20" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This impressive consistency is why I&rsquo;m considering using the Glenfiddich 12 as a sort of benchmarking tool: whenever I have doubts about a certain whisky, I will go back to this one — or one of its older brothers — and reassess my perception of the two.</p>

<p>I have a pretty long journey ahead of me, but something tells me that as a stepping stone, Glenfiddich 12 was probably the perfect choice. Beyond that though, I&rsquo;ll be honest: I suspect this is not a dram I&rsquo;ll be excitedly drinking ten years from now. It&rsquo;s perfectly good, just not terribly interesting. And I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of interesting characters.</p>
