<p>Books and paintings have documented history far further back, but there&rsquo;s nothing like a photo to give you the sense that you&rsquo;re looking at something real. A photo can still misdirect the viewer, but it&rsquo;s still more faithful than a painting or book.</p></blockquote>

<p>What a fantastic collection of pictures; it would be nearly impossible to pick one.</p>

<p>That said, <a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/nikola-tesla-sitting-in-his-laboratory-with-his-magnifying-transmitter/">this one</a> of Nikola Tesla calmly sitting in his laboratory while being surrounded by lightning is pretty damn badass.</p>

<blockquote><p>Earlier on this week, Sony announced the <a href="http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/11/20/new-sony-a7-mk-ii-features-5-axis-stabilization/">A7 Mk II in Japan</a>. But today, they’re finally announcing it here in the US. The camera is the world’s first full frame mirrorless camera with image stabilization built into the sensor. It uses a five axis stabilization system they Sony claims is not the same that Olympus has despite the partnership between the two companies. The company also claims around 4.5 stops of stabilization from the new image stabilized sensor. It will work with all of the lenses that Sony has created as well as third party options, though they state that some lenses aren’t compatible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whoa. 5-Axis in-body image stabilization in a full-frame mirrorless camera that is compatible with Leica M lenses. The whole package.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ernie Button has an amazing photography project going on:</p>

<blockquote><p>The idea for this project occurred while putting a used Scotch glass into the dishwasher.  I noted a film on the bottom of a glass and when I inspected closer, I noted these fine, lacey lines filling the bottom.  What I found through some experimentation is that these patterns and images that you see can be created with the small amount of Single-Malt Scotch left in a glass after most of it has been consumed.  The alcohol dries and leaves the sediment in various patterns.  It’s a little like snowflakes in that every time the Scotch dries, the glass yields different patterns and results.  I have used different color lights to add ‘life’ to the bottom of the glass, creating the illusion of landscape, terrestrial or extraterrestrial.  Some of the images reference the celestial, as if the image was taken of space; something that the Hubble telescope may have taken or an image taken from space looking down on Earth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Extraterrestrial? Sounds about right:</p>

<p>It seems the Macallan planet would be a pretty eerie-looking world. Who would&rsquo;ve thought? By the way, this reminds me, I have <a href="/2014/10/09/the-finer-things-in-life-a-geeks-introduction-to-scotch">homework</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>“8-bit Cinema”</em> is a YouTube playlist by <a href="http://cinefix.com">CineFix</a>. It&rsquo;s a collection of classic — and not so classic — movies retold in the fashion of 8-bit video games, which works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>Some really great movies are represented here, including The Matrix, Silence of the Lambs, The Dark Knight and many more. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Oo3IqyPAc&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL1AXWu-gGX6LNsfQ-KkeGPxL76CFONTom">their latest video</a> is based on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1291150/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> — the 2014 version.</p>

<p>After the excruciating experience of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/">Transformers</a>, I vowed to never again watch another Michael Bay movie, so this probably is as close as I&rsquo;ll ever get to watching TNMT. Bay is involved as a producer and he&rsquo;s already ruined enough childhood memories for me, thank you very much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to embed the video here out of decorum but, as a personal favor to you, dear reader, I&rsquo;ll leave you with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5c5ct1FfM&amp;index=9&amp;list=PL1AXWu-gGX6LNsfQ-KkeGPxL76CFONTom">the 8-bit remake of The Avengers</a> instead:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shawn Blanc takes a trip down memory lane through the pages of his recently-finished <a href="http://www.baronfig.com">Baron Fig</a> notebook:</p>

<blockquote><p>A brand new notebook is too nice to be used. Paper is so full of character. It’s tactile. Real. Fragile. Permanent and impermanent at the same time. It just begs to be used for something awesome. And I never feel that my silly ideas and temporary to-do lists qualify. But if not those, then what?</p>

<p>My Baron Fig and I made a pact. I would use it for the most mundane, menial, impermanent things I could think of. And if I ruined this book by filling it with nothing of consequence, then I would order another to sit on the shelf and collect dust as it waited patiently for something more historic and epic.</p>

<p>But the truth is, when it comes to using our everyday notebooks, quality is found in quantity; meaning in the mundane.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2014/11/25/ep-101">the latest episode</a> of The Talk Show, John Gruber and Christa Mrgan talked about the possibility that the upcoming Apple Watch may be able to act as a remote for Apple TV. They mention Tim Cook making an offhand comment about this during an interview as the source of the idea.</p>

<p>The truth is, not only did Tim Cook say it, but Craig Federighi actually demoed that very same feature on stage in October, during the last <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/2014-oct-event/">Apple keynote</a>. It was towards the end of the segment with the phone call with Stephen Colbert. You can see it in the video below, starting at about the 4:15 mark. Federighi is applying the final tweaks to his <em>&ldquo;Tripling Down on Secrecy&rdquo;</em> presentation and uses AirPlay to preview it on an Apple TV:</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mtjApsQccsY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>


<p>If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll notice that he&rsquo;s actually controlling the Keynote app with his Apple Watch, not just the Apple TV itself, which suggests that the remote capabilities of the Apple Watch will be more advanced than just a simple playback controller.</p>

<p>Gruber also wonders whether this will be a native feature or some add-on capability via an external app, but judging from the video, I definitely believe it will be baked into the watch itself from day one. The fact that it&rsquo;s one of the very few things Apple has actually shown about the device strongly suggests so.</p>

<p>As for whether this feature will require a new Apple TV to work, I&rsquo;d say that remains unclear but then again, nothing in the video suggests that there&rsquo;s anything particularly special about the Apple TV Federighi is using. He just calls it  <em>&ldquo;an Apple TV&rdquo;</em>, or even <em>&ldquo;my Apple TV&rdquo;</em>, almost suggesting that it&rsquo;s the very same one we all already own. Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is anywhere near being conclusive proof, but there you have it. Make of it what you will.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll know soon enough, but this strikes me as a very easy choice for Apple. It would definitely make sense for them to use their existing installed base of Apple TV&rsquo;s — there&rsquo;s already a few million out there — to add another appealing feature to the watch and perhaps get even more people to buy it. Things may change very quickly after the watch&rsquo;s release but as of right now, it&rsquo;s the Apple TV that can help the Apple Watch gain traction in the market, not the other way around, and Apple knows it.</p>

<p>Personally, I think this will prove to be one of the most popular features of the Apple Watch in everyday use. I watch a ton of movies and TV shows on my Apple TV, and I&rsquo;m always scrambling to find the remote. I can&rsquo;t wait for it to be forever glued to my wrist.</p>
