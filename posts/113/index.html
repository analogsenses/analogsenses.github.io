  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Google and Novartis have this morning announced an agreement to collaborate on the development of the smart contact lens that was unveiled by Google X in January. Using non-invasive sensors, the lens promises to analyze tear fluid in the eye to provide constant measurements of a person&#8217;s blood glucose levels. Those can then be sent wirelessly to a mobile device and help diabetics manage their disease more easily.</blockquote>


<p>Fantastic news, though it&rsquo;s still way too early to tell what will come of it (if anything). There are many technical hurdles to overcome in the development of such a device, chief among which is the inherent physiological delay that results from measuring glucose levels in tear fluid instead of blood: what you&rsquo;re measuring in your eye is actually what happened a good 15-20 minutes ago in your bloodstream. If this sensor is intended as a credible diabetes management tool, they need to do better than that. Which, of course, is easier said than done.</p>

<p>The Holy Grail of diabetes management is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pancreas">Artificial Pancreas</a>, which is an autonomous system capable of monitoring a person&rsquo;s blood glucose levels and automatically making decisions in order to ensure they stay within acceptable margins, thus replacing the physiological endocrine functionality of a healthy pancreas. Such a system is theoretically formed, very roughly, by three separate components: a continuous glucose sensor, an insulin/glucagon pump and a predictive algorithm. When all three of them work together, that is, when we achieve a <em>closed-loop</em>, we may describe the system as an artificial pancreas.</p>

<p>The artificial pancreas has indeed been dubbed <em>&ldquo;a technological cure for diabetes&rdquo;</em>,<sup id="fnref:1-70"><a href="#fn:1-70" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and it represents an engineer&rsquo;s dream: a combination of technology and knowledge that genuinely changes lives for the better. Not surprisingly, there are many researchers all over the world, including ourselves, hard at work trying to close the loop, which is proving to be quite a challenge.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.gbt.tfo.upm.es">Bioengineering and Telemedicine Group</a> in Technical University of Madrid, we&rsquo;ve been working on a closed-loop, predictive algorithm for blood glucose control for the past few years.<sup id="fnref:2-70"><a href="#fn:2-70" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Having a reliable and accurate continuous glucose sensor feeding the algorithm is critical to produce clinically useful results, so we&rsquo;re intimately aware of the challenges that exist in this space. In our experience, the biggest issues with the current crop of continuous glucose sensors are their poor accuracy (about 15%, at best) and their need for frequent calibration (up to 6 times a day). Besides, these sensors measure glucose concentration in interstitial tissue, which suffers from similar delays as tear fluid.</p>

<p>These limitations clearly handicap our algorithm&rsquo;s ability to predict future glucose values with sufficient anticipation: any corrective action, like insulin infusion or carbohydrate consumption, takes at least 20 minutes to produce measurable results, so the algorithm needs to be able to make predictions at least that far in advance in order to prevent a hypoglycemic episode before it actually occurs. For reference, our current target for the algorithm is to make accurate predictions 30 minutes into the future.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nobody has yet been able to produce a continuous glucose sensor capable of measuring actual blood glucose concentration, which would be free of such delays. Moreover, Google&rsquo;s device seems designed for a different purpose: by choosing to measure glucose levels in tear fluid they are effectively embracing this limitation and giving up on creating a more ambitious, truly game-changing sensor.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pity, but there&rsquo;s a silver lining: the fact that a big corporation like Google is becoming interested in this field is encouraging, and I hope it inspires others to pick up where Google left off. As a bioengineer, tech-enthusiast and diabetic person myself, I&rsquo;m really excited about the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Excellent article by John Kirk on the strategic mistakes Microsoft keeps making in its repeated attempts to recover the dominant position they held during the 90&rsquo;s. Very appropriate in light of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/ceo/index.html">Satya Nadella&rsquo;s recent public email</a> about the future of the company:</p>

<blockquote>Microsoft could learn much from Sun Tzu. Over the past fifteen to twenty years, Microsoft has engaged in the very worst kind of generalship. Microsoft has allowed their competitors to join forces and successfully scheme against them. Microsoft has responded to the successes of their competitors by forswearing their strongest weapons, abandoning their strongest defensive positions and rushing to attack their competitors wherever they may be, even if those battlefields were located where Microsoft was at its weakest and their competitors were are at their strongest. When these attacks inevitably failed, Microsoft resorted to wars of attrition. Yet in these wars of attrition, it was Microsoft, not their opponents, who suffered most, taking disproportionally greater losses than they inflicted.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is the most special day of the year in men&rsquo;s tennis calendar: the day of the Wimbledon final. Roger Federer will try to win a unprecedented 8th Wimbledon title against Novak Djokovic, the 2011 champion:</p>

<blockquote>Of course, we need look back only 12 months to find a player who did not blow the opposition away in every match throughout the Fortnight, but then came spectacularly good in the final to win in straight sets. Djokovic was on the wrong end of the result that day, and funnily enough will be intent upon reversing the story this time around. He may well succeed. But Federer will grab this latest chance – we have surely learned by now not to describe it as his last – with both hands. The 2014 final is an absolutely intriguing prospect.</blockquote>


<p>For all intents and purposes, Novak Djokovic should be the favorite to win today. But you should count Federer out only at your own risk.</p>

<p>Federer is well past his prime and yet, there&rsquo;s still something special about his game; a certain kind of magic no one can match. The grass of Centre Court is where he&rsquo;s been most successful, a place where he seems able to turn back the clock to his awe-inspiring days. It is truly a joy to watch.</p>

Nearby, at an area known as Yellowknife Bay, the mission met its main goal of determining whether the Martian Gale Crater ever was habitable for simple life forms. The answer, a historic &#8220;yes,&#8221; came from two mudstone slabs that the rover sampled with its drill.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting new smartwatch from Withings. To me, its main appeal is that it looks nothing like a typical smartwatch. Instead, it looks like a traditional, high-quality analog watch, and it does have a certain classic vibe to it. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind wearing one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still too early to say whether the Activité will succeed where others have failed, though. For one thing, what kind of product is this? Who does it appeal to? Feature-wise, it is essentially a fitness tracker disguised as a watch, basically a nice-looking Fitbit. But as a fitness tracker it doesn&rsquo;t make sense: at $390, it&rsquo;s almost four times as expensive as most other fitness-tracking gadgets, all of which offer a similar set of features.</p>

<p>However, at the same time, $390 is still considerably less than the cost of a typical high-end watch and people have no problem paying for those, so it&rsquo;s possible it <em>could</em> work. But it clearly makes more sense to think of this as a watch with some extra features, instead of a fitness tracker that looks like a watch.</p>

<p>The question is, then: is there a significant overlap between both demographics? Or, to put it another way, are people who buy nice watches interested in tracking their fitness? The success of the Activité will probably hinge on the answer to that question.</p>
