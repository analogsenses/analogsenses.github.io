<blockquote><p>If you’re thinking tweets, keep them upbeat and clever. But whatever you do, don’t start an “OH at the studio” account. Because what’s overheard is, quite frankly, a lot of bitching. A lot of pom-pom hat wearing four eyes complaining about how this isn’t “what they fucking signed up for.” My motto is “On Instagram they can’t hear you scream.” Unless you post videos. Don’t ever post videos.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Gemmell:</p>

<blockquote><p>I invite you to bring some balance back to your perception of the world around you, and to push past the historically male-centric gathering of voices. I started by simply following more women on Twitter, and making a conscious effort to amplify those women when the opportunity arose. The <a href="http://twitter.com/mattgemmell/following">list of people I follow</a> now has more female faces than male, and I can’t adequately tell you how much of a relief that is. You should find out for yourself, and maybe use that list as a starting point.</p></blockquote>

<p>I love this idea. We really need to hear more female voices on the Internet, and it all starts with the people we actively choose to follow.</p>

<p>By the way, if you still haven’t subscribed to <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/membership/#the-newsletter">Matt’s weekly email newsletter</a>, I don’t even know what to tell you. He’s downright killing it week in, week out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While we’re on the subject, don’t miss this terrific 4-part interview with legendary American writer Kurt Vonnegut for <em>The Paris Review</em>. I don’t want to spoil it too much for you, so I’ll just say that among many interesting things, he talks at length about his experience as a soldier in World War II:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the same boxcars that had brought up the troops that captured us—probably in the same boxcars that had delivered Jews and Gypsies and Jehovah’s Witnesses and so on to the extermination camps. Rolling stock is rolling stock. British mosquito bombers attacked us at night a few times. I guess they thought we were strategic materials of some kind. They hit a car containing most of the officers from our battalion. Every time I say I hate officers, which I still do fairly frequently, I have to remind myself that practically none of the officers I served under survived. Christmas was in there somewhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let this be a lesson to you: whatever you do in life, you <em>do not</em> want to piss off a great writer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been said before that New York City is street photography Mecca, and with good reason. Also, check out <a href="https://urbantimes.co/2014/04/an-interview-the-life-of-a-photographer-depths-into-the-work-of-richard-sandler/">this interview</a> with Sandler on Urban Times:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I liked what a photograph could do. I was attracted to the idea of stopping time. I always liked films and I grew up in a family that was involved in television…very early television…. late 1940′s….But I always liked photography’s ability to stop time. Film doesn’t stop time, still photography does. That was the initial attraction to actually freeze a moment in time and make prose into poetry.….you have to add so much of your own interpretation to a still image. It becomes very much about the viewer, whereas film and video are much more literal, you see things happen through time, time is not stopped. That was the thing I liked about it, I thought and still think that photography is a very difficult and poetic medium.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Lots of little gems sprinkled here and there, all through the interview. On a side note, Sandler started getting into photography when he was 31, the same age I am now. Who knows, maybe there’s still hope for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you want to try a standing desk for work, Conor McClure has some solid advice for you:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m still not sold on the usefulness of standing mats. It’s easy to see why comfortability should be prioritized, but in reality, it doesn’t need to be; after all, your standing desk exists for better health. If going barefoot for long periods of time is uncomfortable, your goal should be to train that, not eliminate the discomfort with a mat. Put bluntly: if you can’t use your standing desk without a mat for support, you’re a wimp.</p></blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jonathan Poritsky:</p>

<blockquote><p>I don’t turn my phone completely off. I recognize that I <em>could</em>, but the fact is that there are things in this world that might be more important than the movie I’m in. I don’t think any notification that has gone off on my phone during a movie has ever more important than the movie itself, but when that day comes, do I really want to miss it? I’m talking about the big deal stuff: life and, more likely, death. I ignore the tiny buzzing in my pocket just fine.</p>

<p>Now, the exception to keeping my phone in my pocket is simple: if I ever get the dreaded double call, the phone will come partway, though never above the waist, out of my pocket to see who’s calling. If it’s nothing, it slips away out of sight. If it’s something then I spring into action out in the hallway. My loved ones know (as all loved ones really should) that the double call is reserved for emergencies only. I suppose I’d make a similar exception for something like ten texts in a row.</p>

<p>So how does this all play out if you have an Apple Watch?</p></blockquote>

<p>Jonathan gets right one thing that I believe most people get wrong about the Apple Watch’s notification system: It’s not designed to make the notifications you don’t care about more tolerable, it’s designed to make the ones you don’t want to miss more accessible. There’s a profound difference between the two.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Richard J. Anderson pens a brilliant piece on the relationship between empathy and technology:</p>

<blockquote><p>I wonder if it’s possibly that over a certain limit, perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">Dunbar’s Number</a>, the human capacity not only for stable relationships, but for empathy, decreases. The human mind is a hodgepodge of cognitive shortcuts that make it easy for us—all of us—to lump people into categories of who deserves, or doesn’t, our empathy and understanding. I can only speak for myself, with no research to draw on, but I know it’s incredibly difficult for me to empathize with a person who has ended up in the category I’ll call my “shit list.” It’s true that nobody thinks they’re stupid, and everybody has their reasons. That doesn’t mean that I understand. My inability to do so, or even try, for those on the outs with me, is a major shortcoming. My hope is that I share it with others, who seek to overcome.</p></blockquote>
