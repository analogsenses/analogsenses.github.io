  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ben Schiller:</p>

<blockquote><p>The report from <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/organization/portland-state-university">Portland State University</a> looks at eight “<a href="http://www.peopleforbikes.org/green-lane-project">Green Lane</a>” projects sponsored by PeopleForBikes, an <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/explore/advocacy">advocacy</a> group in Colorado. Researchers tracked the impact of the new lanes in Austin, Chicago, Portland (Oregon), San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by analyzing camera footage, interviewing cyclists, and sending out surveys to local residents.</p>

<p>Almost half of riders said they were cycling more frequently as a result of the new lanes, with those on Dearborn Street, in Chicago, reporting the biggest increase. Most importantly, the research found that the lanes increased participation in cycling generally. Ten percent of cyclists said they would have used another form of <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/explore/transportation">transportation</a> before the lanes were built.</p></blockquote>

<p>I could be wrong, but this sounds pretty logical to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My review of the SIRUI T-025X travel tripod was published on Tools &amp; Toys today. If size and weight are important to you, I can’t recommend this tripod enough.</p>

<p>As a side note, this review took a lot of work, particularly those long-exposure shots of Madrid’s Gran Vía and Puerta de Alcalá at night. They were very fun to shoot but man, was it cold. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrF6oskFkbk">Live Composite mode</a> of my E-M10, together with the Remote Shutter mode of the <a href="http://app.olympus-imaging.com/oishare/">Olympus Image Share iPhone app</a> made my life a lot easier, but I <em>really</em> need to get myself a pair of touchscreen-compatible gloves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fascinating story by Christine Dell&#8217;Amore for National Geographic, on how conservators of the <a href="http://www.nzaht.org">Antarctic Heritage Trust</a> restored four portable wooden huts to their original 1917 condition:</p>

<blockquote><p>The buildings include Shackleton&rsquo;s 33-foot-long (10-meter-long) Nimrod hut on Cape Royds, where workers unearthed a stash of whiskey [sic] and brandy, libations that fortified the men during the 1907 Nimrod expedition. Another, the Terra Nova hut on Cape Evans, was the largest Antarctic building of its time at 50 feet (15 meters) long. It <a href="https://www.nzaht.org/AHT/Levicks-notebook/">contained a never-before-seen handwritten notebook of George Murray Levick</a>, a member of Scott&rsquo;s 1910-13 Terra Nova expedition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, obviously. How somebody could survive in the South Pole without a steady supply of whisky is, frankly, beyond me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mine’s been clearly flat and slowly declining — the first time the trend has ever gone down — even in periods where I write a lot. I’ve talked to some friends who have seen similar plateaus and declines over the same period, also for the first time. Inbound links from bigger sites also aren’t worth as much as they used to be, suggesting that even big sites are struggling to maintain and grow their traffic.</p>

<p>Nobody’s really talking about it, but I suspect this is a wider trend: blogs aren’t dying, but they are significantly declining. 2015 might be a rough year.</p></blockquote>

<p>I, too, am sensing this trend, and I’ll be perfectly honest: it scares the crap out of me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dustin Curtis makes an interesting observation on how some technologies grow to become personality-defined choices once they mature:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think the same thing is happening right now in the computer and mobile devices industry. Computers and phones have historically been sold based on performance, screen size, and battery life. The slow march of technological progress through the 1990s and 2000s was obvious to anyone who knows the word “megahertz”. But in the past couple of years, I think we have finally reached the 1945 equivalent in automobiles: all devices sold today can do everything any reasonable customer would want. The computer is now feature-complete. Almost all model segmentation is now based on the personality of the customer.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My apologies, because everybody you know on the Internet has probably also linked to this fantastic profile of Jony Ive by Ian Parker for The New Yorker, but I simply couldn’t let it pass.</p>

<p>More than any particulars about Ive’s work (of which the piece, unsurprisingly, reveals very little), what I find fascinating is Ive’s depiction of his personal friendship and professional relationship with Steve Jobs:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <em>Wired</em> article appeared that June. The next month, Jobs, who had left Apple twelve years earlier, and gone on to launch Pixar and NeXT, returned as Apple’s C.E.O., supplanting Gilbert Amelio. Jobs and Ive had an intense first meeting. Ive said, “I can’t really remember that happening really ever before, meeting somebody when it’s just like that”—he snapped his fingers. “It was the most bizarre thing, where we were both perhaps a little—a little bit odd. We weren’t used to clicking.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote><p>At Jobs’s memorial, which was held on the lawn at Infinite Loop, Ive said, “Steve used to say to me—and he used to say this a lot—‘Hey, Jony, here’s a dopey idea.’ And sometimes they were: really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones which, in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound.” Ive said to me, “I couldn’t be more mindful of him. How could I not, given our personal relationship, and given that I’m still designing in the same place, at the same table, where I spent the last fifteen years with him sat next to me?”</p></blockquote>

<p>But as those of us who have had to rely on our backups in the past know, the act of backing up is only the first small step in the full equation — it’s being able to <em>restore</em> that really matters.</p></blockquote>
