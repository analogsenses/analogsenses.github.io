  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Huff got his hands on an advanced prototype of the next lens in the Loxia lineup:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the 21 f.2.8 arrived I loved it for its small size and quality Loxia build. Feels the same as the other two in the Loxia line and that is a good thing as these lenses are built very well, even including a rubber seal around the mount to avoid dust getting in. The Loxia line of lenses from Zeiss are just what the doctor ordered for most of us who love a manual shooting experience with small high quality lenses.</p></blockquote>

<p>The images are gorgeous. No word on pricing or release date on this piece, but the lens is already available for preorder <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1189220-REG/zeiss_2131_999_loxia_21mm_f_2_8_lens.html">at B&amp;H</a> for $1,499, with an estimated availability date of mid December 2015.</p>

<p>I’m still not sold on the Loxia lenses for the most part, but I have to admit this does seem to be a fine piece of glass. Then again, $1,499 sounds quite steep for a lens like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, what do you know. It’s been almost a month since iOS 9 arrived — and content blockers with it — and the sky still hasn’t fallen on the heads of all those poor web publishers. Of course, that hasn’t stopped anyone from talking and writing about it <em>ad infinitum</em>, and the trend continued this week.</p>

<p>This tendency to over-analyze and dissect everything is clearly present in much of the writing that goes up online these days, particularly in the tech community.<sup id="fnref:1-65"><a href="#fn:1-65" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> At the end of the day, though, life goes on, and regular people simply don’t care much about these things, if at all.</p>

<p>We’ll see what the real damage that can be attributed to ad blockers is when the dust settles but for now, in the absence of real, verifiable data from publishers or advertisers, the whole debate has reached a sort of standoff: both sides have clearly made their argument, and now it’s up for regular people at large to decide whether ad blockers are worth using or not.</p>

<p>Now, for a more enjoyable time, let’s move on to some of this week’s most interesting pieces of writing.</p>

<h2>Issue #18: Life with a Plus-sized iPhone, diversity in tech, gender stereotypes, and apps vs Starbucks</h2>

<p>This issue comes packed with cool pieces, as usual.</p>

<p>First up there are a couple user reports on the iPhone 6S Plus, with different but equally valid and interesting observations. Then we move on to a couple tech-related pieces, including a very controversial one that was taken down by Forbes, and we take a look at gender stereotypes and how they can go both ways. Then it’s time for a few photography-related articles and finally, we round out the issue with a few more light-hearted and hopefully fun to read pieces.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<h3><a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2015/10/thirteen-days-with-an-iphone-6s-plus/">Thirteen days with an iPhone 6S Plus | Shawn Blanc →</a></h3>

<p>Shawn Blanc shared his experience with the iPhone 6S Plus earlier in the week:</p>

<blockquote><p>My friends who also use a 6/6s Plus told me to give it at least a week or two. It’s been 13 days, and I’m still not sure about it.</p>

<p>There are some things which I love about the phone. Namely: the superior mechanics for photography and videography, and the bigger screen real-estate. But I am not yet convinced that the tradeoff for those things — having a device that is unwieldy at best when using it with one hand — is worth it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shawn is finding himself at a crossroads, like many people in the past year. Ben Brooks <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/thirteen-days-with-an-iphone-6s-plus/">said it best</a>: the iPhone 6S Plus is not the best phone in the world, but it is the best pocket computer in the world. Framing it like that, it really makes a lot more sense.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♧</p>


<h3><a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/10/iphone-6s-plus-review">iPhone 6S Plus review | Stephen Hackett →</a></h3>

<p>Another great take on the Plus-sized iPhone:</p>

<blockquote><p>I know the Plus isn’t for everyone, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MykeWasRight">but it is for me</a>. The 5.5 inch, 401 ppi display isn’t just beautiful, but I find the additional space (and increased battery capacity) useful as this is the most-used device I own. Thankfully, every year, my pocket computer gets better, right on schedule.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/twitters-moment/">Twitter’s moment | Ben Thompson →</a></h3>

<p>Interesting — and optimistic — thoughts on Twitter the company by Ben Thompson:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think, though, it’s time for a new prediction: that the summer of 2015 will be seen as the low point for Twitter, and that this week in particular will mark the start of something new and valuable. Crucially, the reasons why are directly related to why I was bearish for so long: the product, the CEO, and the stock.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ben’s article comes right on the heels of Jack Dorsey’s triumphant return to Twitter as CEO. It seems there’s hope and good vibes all around for Twitter these days, as if in the hands of Dorsey Twitter could somehow do no wrong.</p>

<p>I’m nowhere near as optimistic, but I hope Ben is right. The world is clearly better off with Twitter as a healthy company than it is with Twitter struggling to turn a profit and doing all sorts of sketchy things to its users in order to monetize them.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.brianshall.com/2015/10/07/the-article-on-diversity-in-tech-that-forbes-took-down/">The article on diversity in tech that Forbes took down | Brian S. Hall →</a></h3>

<p>Brian S. Hall hit a nerve earlier in the week with a piece that was published on Forbes, provocatively titled <em>“there is no diversity crisis in tech”</em>. In it, he argued that Silicon Valley is first and foremost a meritocracy, and that the so-called diversity crisis in tech amounts to little more than people making excuses and not working hard enough to get what they want.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the criticism the piece — and Hall himself — garnered was so brutal that Forbes ended up taking the piece down, but not until more than 24 hours had passed and the article had generated tens of thousands of pageviews, which is certainly a bit hypocritical on their part.</p>

<p>Hall has now republished the piece on his own site for all the world to see, and he’s standing behind it despite all the controversy.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t agree with Hall’s point, and I’m convinced the diversity crisis in tech is a very real, very serious problem.</p>

<p>That said, I’m linking to his piece here because I don’t believe in censorship, and I find Forbes’s behavior in this whole story to have been shameful, to say the least. If they published the piece in the first place, they should have owned up to it and left it up, despite the criticism they must have known it would garner.</p>

<p>What they’ve done — reaping the benefits of the situation and <em>then</em> hanging Hall out to dry — is quite simply despicable.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/oct/09/breasts-ultimate-weapons-video-games">Breasts: the ultimate weapons | Dean Burnett →</a></h3>

<p>And since we’re talking about controversial topics, this hilarious peace on the over-sexualized appearance of many female characters in comics and video games is certainly a winner:</p>

<blockquote><p>The gyroscopic properties and ability to store highly dangerous fluids are also results of the unique physics of breasts, but it also provides a distinct defensive property. Bullets and blades are very dangerous to humans due to the laws of conventional physics, but breasts <em>don’t obey these laws</em>, so are practically invulnerable to traditional weapons. You seldom see any of these comic or game characters with damaged breasts, and now you know why.</p>

<p>And if they’re invulnerable, there’s no real point in covering them with clothes. Clothes are damageable, so you’ll just ruin a good outfit.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/09/28/444236895/how-poker-player-annie-duke-used-gender-stereotypes-to-win-matches">How poker player Annie Duke used gender stereotypes to win matches | Shankar Vedantam →</a></h3>

<p>I loved this story. If you can, listen to <a href="http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/atc/2015/09/20150928_atc_how_poker_player_annie_duke_used_gender_stereotypes_to_win_matches.mp3">the full recording</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>DUKE: I figured it was part of the game that if somebody was at the table who was so emotionally invested in the fact that I was a woman, that they could treat me that way, that probably, that person wasn’t going to make good decisions at the table against me. So I really tried to sort of separate that out and think about it from a strategic place of, how can I come up with the best strategy to take their money because I guess, in the end, isn’t that the best revenge?</p></blockquote>

<p>It is, indeed.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467107/walt-mossberg-web-ads">Mossberg: the real trouble with web ads | Walt Mossberg →</a></h3>

<p>Walt Mossberg:</p>

<blockquote><p>I would gladly opt into seeing ads I found useful and relevant, just as I opt into reading content I find useful and relevant. And such opt-ins would even give the industry better information about what people might want to buy on a regular basis. If opting in is a bridge too far, I would even grudgingly settle for a clear, easy, universal way to opt out of ads that don’t work for me, or which are clumsy and obtrusive. That, too, should be useful information for sophisticated, up-front advertisers and the ad buyers they employ.</p>

<p>But web users in most cases can do neither, so some turn to blunt weapons like ad blockers, which do inflict collateral damage, especially on small web sites. Yes, the industry has created various ways of reporting bad ads. And an organization called the Digital Advertising Alliance has a program where some advertisers agree to place little blue triangles in ads, which users can click to report bad ones or to opt out of targeted advertising on a site. But, at least in my experience, that little blue triangle doesn’t show in most ads.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with his general take, but I don’t accept his assumption that ad blocking will hurt small sites more than the bigger ones like <em>The Verge</em>. If anything, the rise of ad blockers will probably increase the value proposition of native advertising, which is precisely the form of advertising best suited to small sites. Native advertising doesn’t scale well, but it can be a very viable way for a small site to thrive.</p>

<p>Mossberg and the rest of big-website publishers are trying very hard to appear selfless and generous, as if they’re just looking out for the small guy. <em>We’re fine here, it’s the little ones that will be hurt by all this</em>.</p>

<p>Time will tell, but I suspect the reality is very different. Clearly, they are the ones who have more to lose if ad blocking becomes the norm. And I bet he knows that, too.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/10/06/how-to-straight-razor-shave/">Shave like your great grandpa: the ultimate straight razor shaving guide | Brett McKay →</a></h3>

<p>Solid primer on straight razor shaving over at <em>The Art of Manliness</em>. I disagree with this bit, though:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many right handed shavers switch hands to shave the left side of their face. Personally, I don’t trust the dexterity and touch in my left hand to make the switch. So I continue using my right hand to shave.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shaving with your left hand — if you’re right-handed, that is — is scary at first, especially with a straight razor, but it’s surprisingly easy to learn. After only a couple shaves I quickly started to get the hang of it, and now I’d say I’m actually <em>better</em> at shaving the left side of my face than the right one.</p>

<p>The reason to use your left hand on the left side is that you should always follow the growth pattern of your beard, and that can change depending on the particular area you’re shaving. Due to the design of the razor itself, following that pattern cross-handed is often impractical, and sometimes even risky.</p>

<p>The initial resistance to maneuver a razor-sharp — quite literally — blade around your throat with your non-dominant hand is entirely understandable, but it is rooted in fear, not logic. If you’re careful, and patient, you’ll quickly get over it, and you’ll be surprised at how much better your shaves get.</p>

<h3><a href="https://photographylife.com/recommended-sony-a7r-ii-settings">Recommended Sony A7R II settings | Nasim Mansurov →</a></h3>

<p>With so many customizable buttons, and so many menu items on Sony cameras, finding the optimal configuration for your shooting style is far from trivial. This excellent piece provides plenty of guidance on how to set the Sony A7R II just the way you like it.</p>

<p class="card-separator">♡</p>


<h3><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/pitching-my-snakes-on-a-plane-remake">Pitching my “Snakes on a Plane” remake | Anna Heyward →</a></h3>

<p>I really can’t think of a better piece to close this issue:</p>

<blockquote><p>I know what you’re thinking: this movie has already been made. Why make it again? But hear me out. I really think I could make it better. For one, we could have it be a bit more gritty and realistic. So, instead of the snakes—which, I admit, are a fun touch, if a bit far-fetched—it’d be a normal American Airlines flight, and the fantastical element is introduced when the plane’s just sitting on the tarmac for two hours and forty-five minutes. Yes, that’s right, <em>just sitting there</em>. No, the audience doesn’t know the reason; neither do the characters. Instead of dramatic irony, it’s, like, the audience and the characters are bound together by American Airlines in their powerlessness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds horrifying.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/im-really-not-serious/">Stop comparing app prices to cups of Starbucks | Ben Brooks →</a></h3>

<p>Nope, I was wrong. This article from late last night is the perfect way to close the issue. Ben Brooks lists all the reasons why a cup of Starbucks is actually a better value than most apps:</p>

<blockquote><p>There was actual work put into this “latte”, and I know the because I saw them do it. Look, my nephew makes “apps” in his basement and I think it’s not very hard because he’s just not very smart. He can’t even carry a conversation — like <em>at all</em>. I think he mostly just watches porn down there, but that’s pure speculation as I am far too engaged in my social graph to go check.</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire piece is full of awesome.</p>

<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>This is a long weekend in Spain, and I’m spending it in my hometown, as usual. Spain’s national holiday is on Monday, and Madrid will be occupied by a military parade, with fireworks and everything. It’s a fine display of patriotism, but I’ve already seen it plenty of times and I could really use some quiet time at home to get some work done.</p>

<p>As such, the rest of my weekend will probably be spent at the computer, or behind the camera. I’m hard at work on my review of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H7JGOS4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00H7JGOS4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=analogsens-20&amp;linkId=DBJYAJS44V3KI7K2">Capture Clip</a> for <em>Tools &amp; Toys</em>, which should be published next Tuesday, and after that I have a couple other projects coming up that I’m very eager to tackle.</p>

<p class="full-width"><img src="/assets/images/flickr/21883449270_0eaeb385f0_o.jpg"/></p>




<p class="full-width"><img src="/assets/images/flickr/22071627925_4a777eab35_o.jpg"/></p>


<p>Next week I’ll also be doing a portrait session with a good friend, and that will be a great opportunity to put the 70-200mm lens to good use once again. I just hope the weather is good because apparently, there’s a big storm coming. I’ll be sure to share a few images from the session, as well as my ongoing thoughts on the lens, and the camera.</p>

<p>Other than that, things have now settled into a kind of busy routine for the past few weeks, and I’m happy with the way everything is going. Granted, I’d love to have more time on my hands to do some longform writing, but I guess that will have to be put on hold for now. Hopefully I’ll be able to pick it up again before long.</p>

<p>And on that note, we’ve reached the end of yet another issue of Morning Coffee. I can’t believe there’s already 18 in the can with this one. It somehow still feels brand new, as if it was only yesterday that I published the first one. I don’t know if that’s a good sign, but I’ll take it.</p>

<p>Enjoy the rest of your weekend and, as ever, thank you for reading.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Voigtlander today announced three new native E-mount lenses: the 10mm f/5.6 Hyper Wide Heliar, 12mm f/5.6 Ultra Wide Heliar, and 15mm f/4.5 Super Wide Heliar.</p>

<p>The 10mm lens is the first ever Full Frame lens in that focal length. As for the other two lenses, this is what Mathieu Gasquet wrote over at <em>MirrorLessons</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The 12mm and 15mm lenses are based on the current VM versions. What’s new is that these E-Mount lenses will have electronic contacts so that the camera will be able to record exif data, including the focal length. Also, when using the focus ring, you can automatically activate the focus magnifier assist as you can do with the <a href="http://www.mirrorlessons.com/2014/12/12/the-birth-of-a-new-family-zeiss-loxia-35mm-and-50mm-full-review/">Zeiss Loxia</a> lenses. Since the lenses will also communicate information such as the focusing distance, the A7 mark II series should be able to use 5 axis sensor stabilisation instead of only 3 axis.</p></blockquote>

<p>All three lenses look great, although personally, I’m not really interested in any of them. They’re just too wide for my current needs.</p>

<p>A more important thing to note, however, is what this represents: yet another historical advantage of DSLRs — a wealth of high quality and affordable 3rd-party lenses — going out the window.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before traditional 3rd-party lens makers like Voigtlander, Sigma and Tamron started doing native E-mount versions of their lenses. Voigtlander has been the first to market, but I’m willing to bet both Sigma and Tamron will follow suit sooner than you think.</p>

<p>With every passing month and year, the list of reasons to buy a DSLR over a mirrorless camera keeps getting shorter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great news from Marco:</p>

<blockquote><p>After a year of work, Overcast 2 is now available as a free update for everyone. It’s mostly a major under-the-hood improvement, with relatively few user-facing changes. But they’re pretty good, I think.</p>

<p>And now, <strong>all features are free</strong>, and I’m trying a new business model.</p></blockquote>

<p>Overcast 2 adds some really awesome features like streaming, which will allow you to start playing an episode immediately, instead of having to wait for it to fully download to your device. I’ve been looking forward to this feature ever since Overcast was first released, and I can’t wait to try it out.</p>

<p>As for the new business model, Marco is now offering a $1 monthly patronage option within the app:</p>

<blockquote><p>If only 5% of customers become monthly patrons, Overcast will match its previous revenue.</p>

<p>Patrons may get special features in the future if I can’t afford to offer something to everyone (due to hosting costs, etc.), but today, patronage is simply that: supporting Overcast directly, because you want to. And if you’d rather not, no hard feelings.</p></blockquote>

<p>Simple, easy, and respectful towards his customers. In other words, quintessentially Marco. I’m sold.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fantastic work by Matthew Gore over at <em>Light &amp; Matter</em>. He took some of the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/projectapolloarchive/albums/with/72157658983462236">recently released</a> images of the Apollo space program and “fixed” them:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of the images are already iconic, but the vast majority of them are new to me, and I’ve now spent countless hours enthralled by them. Perhaps it’s the years that I spent processing and gazing at rolls of negatives, but there’s something about looking at a dozen mediocre images… some in focus, some poorly framed, others under-exposed, some with motion blur… that increases the impact and brings home the reality of all of them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the scans have not been corrected for color and exposure, so they tend to be flat and tinted. For those of you who like the Instagram-filter look, they’re just fine; it does add a bit of vintage charm. My instinct, though, is to repair them… to try to give them them accurate color and the crispness of a full-tonal range.</p></blockquote>

<p>The difference an accurate white balance makes is striking; I much prefer the corrected images.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vlad Savov, writing for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The very concept of a Microsoft <em>hardware</em> event still feels weird to me. Software constitutes half of Microsoft’s name and most of its DNA, and yet today we were treated to a 110-minute presentation showing off Microsoft’s hardware-engineering acumen. And the whole thing was so breathlessly exciting that it felt more like 110 seconds. The most inspiring, intriguing, and frankly irresistible new hardware today is coming from Microsoft.</p></blockquote>

<p>No hyperbole here whatsoever. But wait, there’s more:</p>

<blockquote><p>Having already shown us the software part of its new strategy with <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/28/9045331/microsoft-windows-10-review">Windows 10</a>, Microsoft today completed the equation with delightfully attractive new hardware. It has rekindled my excitement for new devices, at the tail end of a year where innovation seemed to be either lacking or <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/5/9265527/sony-xperia-z5-4k-display-ifa-2015">all too predictable</a>. Today, Microsoft surprised, wowed, and delighted. It generated passion where there once was pessimism. Kudos!</p></blockquote>

<p>I get it, Microsoft’s event was exciting, and the new products they announced look polished and well designed. The Surface Book, in particular, is an interesting take on the tablet/laptop duality, and it may prove to be a very successful product for Microsoft. But really, Savov’s level of excitement in this piece is just too much for me.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but this feels a heck of a lot like he’s trying very hard to <em>create</em> buzz, rather than being genuinely excited about what he’s seen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Juli Clover, over at <em>MacRumors</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Disney Story Artist Jeff Ranjo <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffRanjo/status/651452347814535168">shared a Periscope</a> that demonstrates the iPad Pro in action, and several images of the Disney team’s drawings were shared on Twitter. The Disney team was using a beta version of popular drawing app <em>Procreate</em>, which has been updated to work with the iPad Pro, and an iPad Pro version of <em>Paper by Fiftythree</em> was also shown off.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was cool to watch, but I’m not sure how representative it is of the iPad Pro’s capabilities in the hands of regular humans. I mean, those guys are so incredibly talented I’m sure they could draw just as well with something as crude as a piece of paper and a simple pencil.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great interview with the writer and director of the upcoming movie ‘Steve Jobs’:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Sorkin:</strong> Mrs. Jobs, Tim Cook, Bill Campbell—they have not seen the movie and have not read the screenplay. I don’t begrudge Laurene Jobs any of what she’s feeling right now, especially on the anniversary of her husband’s death. From what I’ve read that they’re assuming of what’s in the movie, that it’s a hit job, I think if they do see the movie they’ll be pleasantly surprised. But I can’t emphasize this enough: They haven’t seen the movie.</p>

<p><strong>Boyle:</strong> You respect the personal grief. This guy is one of the most important figures in our lives, and these people [tech executives], I’m afraid, they have to be written about. They have to be examined. There will be many, many more films made about them. The world is changing beyond recognition. Apple is pretty good on issues like data and privacy, but we have to examine these people in a big political way or in a personal way, like this film tries to do.</p></blockquote>

<p>Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve’s wife, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-co-founders-allies-take-aim-at-hollywood-over-steve-jobs-1444000308">recently</a> voiced her concerns about the movie, stating that “any movie based on [Walter Isaacson’s] book could not possibly be accurate”. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.</p>
