<div class="entry-content"><p>Hey there, welcome to <strong>Analog Senses</strong>.</p>

<p>First, let me tell you what this is all about, FAQ-style:</p>

<p><strong>Who are you? </strong></p>

<p>My name is Álvaro Serrano, I&rsquo;m 26 years old and I am from Spain. I currently live in Madrid, where I&rsquo;m working at Polytechnical University of Madrid (UPM), developing software for Biomedical Engineering applications.</p>

<p>I got my MSc degree in Telecommunication Engineering from UPM last year, with Bioengineering and Telemedicine as my major. I&rsquo;m also enrolled in a post-graduate program in Bioengineering and Telemedicine in the same university so, as you can imagine, I don&rsquo;t get bored much.</p>

<p>I like reading, drawing, going to the movies <em>a lot</em> and listening to music. I&rsquo;m a Mac user and my favorite sport is tennis (big-time Federer fan). I&rsquo;m also a proud Spaniard, which means whenever I&rsquo;m not at work or in class, I&rsquo;m probably out with friends enjoying the fine Spanish weather or having a few beers (we call them cañas).</p>

<p>If you want to know more, you probably are a bit too curious. Shoot me an e-mail and I&rsquo;ll be glad to answer any questions you may have. You can reach me on contact@analogsenses.com, or on Twitter: @analogsenses.</p>

<p><strong>So, what is this all about? </strong></p>

<p>I consider myself a creative person. Not necessarily an artsy type or anything like that, but ideas have always come to me about a lot of things I could do, paint, write or say. Up until a few months back, my plate had been mostly full with my studies and the rest of the stuff I was going through. Now, however, for the first time in years I find myself out of excuses not to do something about those ideas. And so here we are.</p>

<p>This is a formal attempt to capture some of those ideas and reflections and let them out of my head. Sometimes I will write something, others it will be a picture or a drawing, a good quote that got me thinking or a link to a cool website or post that I have seen elsewhere but that you should totally check out.</p>

<p>I will probably write about many things, because that is the nature of my thinking process: I don&rsquo;t usually focus on just one topic, but rather a few ones that are important to me. Among the posts here you will find stories about the Internet, technology in general and Apple in particular, productivity, minimalism and whatever I may be up to (movies, songs, books, etc.). Occasionally you may have to bear with some tennis-related posts, but I will do my best to keep them under control, as I understand they may be a little off-topic. But I know myself, and I know I won&rsquo;t be able to resist if there&rsquo;s a big event going on, specially if Federer is playing.</p>

<p><strong> OK, but what&rsquo;s with the <em>analog</em> thing? </strong></p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, I just thought it sounded cool, and the domain was available :-P</p>

<p>Kidding aside, it seemed like a good way to indicate that this is not a technical blog, even though it may include posts about technology. Hence the <em>analog</em>, as opposed to <em>digital</em>. Rest assured, I will not use Geek language here (well, let&rsquo;s just say not much Geek language) or get lost about how many hours it took me to compile the code of the application I&rsquo;m working on. My purpose is to make every post readable by as many people as possible. I want to write in a way that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are an engineer, a musician, a nurse or a sportsman, you will be able to find something here that piques your curiosity and hopefully, your interest.</p>

<p>Also, <em>Analog Senses</em> is meant to let readers know that this blog will talk about various different things, that it is essentially a window through which we can look at a digital world, from an analog perspective.</p>

<p><strong> How often will you be posting? </strong></p>

<p>The posting schedule will not be fixed, but it is my intention to add at least one new text post every week, even though so far I&rsquo;ve been failing miserably in doing so. Aside from that, there may be links, pictures, quotes or brief messages. I am perfectly aware that time is an increasingly precious thing in a world that moves faster every day, so I promise you that I will not waste yours with senseless posts. I will only write when I have something to say that I believe adds some value to the blog. This is my commitment to you. If you ever feel that I have lost my way, please write me up and let me know what you think.</p>

<p><strong>Wait a second… if you&rsquo;re from Spain, why the hell do you write in English? </strong></p>

<p>I know, I get this a lot. Well, there are various reasons why I chose to write this blog in English. First and foremost, I believe that English is the natural language of the Internet. The reason why anyone writes a blog and puts it out there is so that their content reaches the maximum number of people, and I believe English will provide me with a better way to do so.</p>

<p>Second, some if not all of the topics I will cover here are far more popular in the English-speaking world than they are in Spain (take Apple, for example). While this may be debatable, it is my opinion and ultimately my choice.</p>

<p>Third, I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to write decent English. My intention is to let the content speak for itself, and I hope that my writing is not a problem for anyone. Of course, I accept and welcome criticism and corrections, so if you ever see a blatant error anywhere, please let me know so I can learn from it and correct it immediately. Thanks.</p>

<p>And last but not least, for some reason I find it easier to write in English sometimes. It&rsquo;s as though thinking in a foreign language helps me to narrow down my chain of thought and focus on whatever it is I want to say. Weird as that may be.</p>

<p>Well, I guess that&rsquo;s enough for the first day. Welcome aboard, I really do hope you enjoy your stay.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Álvaro.</p>
