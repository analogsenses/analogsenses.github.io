<div class="entry-content"><p>This is an article about iOS 7 that never was. It could have been a great write-up, full of insightful ideas and clever comments about Apple&rsquo;s new version of its flagship operating system. It could have had critique, analysis, maybe a dash of speculation, just a couple of educated guesses about the future and how it will affect our lives as users in general, and my life as a developer in particular. It could have been all that and more, and yet it is none of those things. It looks like I&rsquo;m spinning, I know. Just bear with me.</p>

<p>The thing is, I actually wanted to write an article about iOS 7, but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to do it. I thought about it long and hard, and despite my initial excitement in the moments after the keynote, deep down I kind of always knew I wasn&rsquo;t really going to do it. Writing about these topics has been tough for me lately. Every time I sit in front of a keyboard I get this nagging feeling that every idea I have has already been posted somewhere else and repeated ad nauseam, often in a much more articulate and coherent way. So, I slacked. I began trusting others to make the points I wanted to make. To express opinions that, while my own, are not unique. Not even slightly.</p>

<p>The most difficult part for me is finding something that hasn&rsquo;t been said before, adding something of value, which is the whole point to begin with. I don&rsquo;t like being an echo chamber. Citing John Gruber or Matt Gemmell is fine every now and then, but it&rsquo;s not cool when that&rsquo;s all you ever do on your own site. And I can&rsquo;t escape the feeling that that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing. Let me be clear: I have strong feelings about Analog Senses. It may not be much in the general context of the Internet, just a tiny space nobody really pays attention to, but this little site means the world to me. It does not sit well with me to let it languish into oblivion. I know exactly what I want it to be and it pains me to see that I have not lived up to that idea. And so here I am.</p>

<p>Of course, I have my excuses and justifications. Too much work, not enough time, I could check all the usual items off the list. They&rsquo;re all true, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. There&rsquo;s always an excuse if you want to find one. But even then, I still wanted to write about iOS 7. I really, really did. I felt like, if I care about this at all, I should add my voice to the conversation. I should have something to say. Even if I had no idea what it was, I wanted to try and find it. However, that&rsquo;s beside the point now. There is a far bigger task ahead of me, and it starts right now.</p>

<p>Excuses aside, the fact remains I haven&rsquo;t truly committed to writing. I don&rsquo;t mean it in the sense of writing something remarkable, like a novel or a scientific article. My goal is much simpler: I just want to write. About something, anything. Write every day, as the saying goes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a pile of garbage, so long as I keep writing. There was a time when I used to do that. And maybe I&rsquo;m idealizing it a bit, but I remember it as a good time. Maybe that&rsquo;s just it. Maybe I want to write every day because <em>writing makes me happy</em>. Wait, I need to say that again. Writing makes me happy. Heck, it&rsquo;s as good a reason as any. When I look back at some of the things I&rsquo;ve written in the past, I can&rsquo;t believe I some of them are actually mine. It makes me proud, but it obviously makes me sick as well, to see that I have it in me, to know that I could do it and yet, day after day, I choose not to. Because in the end, that&rsquo;s what this is: a choice.</p>

<p>This is not an article about iOS 7. This is me, committing. This is me, choosing to show up every day to tell you a story that only I can tell. I can&rsquo;t promise it will always be good, or even interesting. All I can promise is that it will be honest.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to have you along for the ride.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
