<div class="entry-content"><p>I love bicycles.</p>

<p>I believe it&rsquo;s one of the most remarkable inventions in human history and if I can, I ride one every day. I don&rsquo;t mean in a sporty, lycra-clad kind of way, but as a normal person wearing everyday clothes. The bicycle is my usual means of transportation in Madrid.</p>

<p>Bicycles thrive in the city, where the average trip is often just a couple km long. In that scenario it is usually, by far, the most convenient way to move from point A to point B,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> without having to worry about things like finding a parking spot. It also happens to be really good for your health.</p>

<p>Up until 2011 I had been using the same bicycle since I was 15 years old: an old <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/6182098088/">Kona Lava Dome from 1998</a>. I love it. I&rsquo;ve used the heck out of it for over 10 years and it&rsquo;s never let me down. It&rsquo;s still in pretty good shape, considering the abuse it has endured over the years. However, riding a mountain bike in the city, especially one like Madrid, is not ideal, so after a couple years of daily use I decided it was time for a change.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I also appreciate nice things. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a Mac and iOS user, among other things. I value attention to detail and I recognize great design when I see it. When someone <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/">sweats the details</a>, it shows. And I like that.</p>

<p>When it comes to sweating the details in the bicycle world, there&rsquo;s a name that&rsquo;s in a class of its own: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianchi_Bicycles">Bianchi</a>. They&rsquo;re the oldest bicycle manufacturer in the world. They&rsquo;ve been making bicycles since 1885, almost 130 years ago, and they&rsquo;re a fundamental part of the history of the bicycle.</p>

<p>It should then come as no surprise that when I decided to buy my first nice bicycle, I chose a Bianchi:</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3920/14951274710_ec8308e509_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful Bianchi Pista Steel from 2011, and it was the first bicycle I ever bought for myself. Today I own four different bicycles, but the Bianchi remains the only one I have purchased new from a local bike store. It&rsquo;s gorgeous.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5560/14951248399_46690d28aa_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>The craftsmanship and attention to detail are evident anywhere you look. In the time that I&rsquo;ve had it, I&rsquo;ve replaced and upgraded many of its components, but its essence remains intact: that beautiful piece of chrome-finished steel with Bianchi decals on it. The frame is the true soul of a bicycle, and mine&rsquo;s is a stunner.</p>

<p>Riding it is also one hell of an experience. Fixed-gear bicycles are so much fun. I hadn&rsquo;t enjoyed myself so much on a bike since I was 10 years old. I feel very fortunate to own this bicycle, because it is exactly the one I wanted.</p>

<p>However, in the past 12 months, I have barely touched it. It&rsquo;s been mostly sitting on its rack at home, begging to be used. And it makes me sad.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The problem with nice things is that they tend to get noticed more than we&rsquo;d like, and my Bianchi is not an exception. It gets looks and comments from strangers on a regular basis. Most of them are compliments, with the occasional bit of skepticism thrown in for good measure.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> I like it when a stranger feels curious about my bike, but all that attention means the idea of leaving it locked on the streets makes me extremely uneasy.</p>

<p>For a while, I managed. I resorted to pretty much the only thing I could do: I would take the bike with me anywhere I went, even if it was a place were bicycles are normally not allowed. I have taken it inside clothing stores, banks&hellip; you name it. Even restaurants. It certainly made for some interesting conversations with the security personnel sometimes.</p>

<p>After a while though, I got tired of arguing. Laziness started to creep in, and I realized it wasn&rsquo;t worth it to keep fighting about the bike all the time, instead of doing whatever I was supposed to be doing. I just wanted to get my stuff done with as little fuss as possible, and in that regard, my bike wasn&rsquo;t helping.</p>

<p>And so, last year I decided to try a different approach and I bought another bicycle. A <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/upgrade.html#beater">beater bike</a>, as they say. They&rsquo;re the polar opposite of nice bikes: the kind of bikes no one would bother to steal, but even if someone did, you wouldn&rsquo;t really care that much.</p>

<p>If you take your time, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to find an old bicycle in reasonably good condition for very little money. After a few weeks looking I eventually found a great candidate: a classic hybrid Peugeot Eton 21 from 1990. It was in pretty good shape and I bought it for about $80.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> That&rsquo;s almost 20 times cheaper than my Bianchi. And you know what? It may be the best purchase I&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5553/14953854637_861eee80fe_h.jpg"/></p>


<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s no head-turner: it&rsquo;s old, the frame is rusty in places and it has a certain utilitarian look to it, but that&rsquo;s precisely the point. It blends right in. So much so, in fact, that last week I forgot to remove my LED lights and left them on the bike over the weekend and when I came back, after a full 72 hours on the street, the lights were still there. Nobody had even looked at the bike twice. That&rsquo;s peace of mind that money can&rsquo;t buy.</p>

<p>Thanks to this bike, I have discovered the pleasures of stress-free riding. I don&rsquo;t care if it gets chipped, or stolen. I even leave it out on the street at night. Not having to carry a bike on the elevator every time I leave the house is another huge plus. Anytime I want to use it, it&rsquo;s right there, waiting for me. It&rsquo;s truly become the most convenient means of urban transportation I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>

<p>Besides, since I don&rsquo;t need to worry about aesthetics, I can put big, fat tires on it, fenders and a huge rack to help me carry my bags. Now it&rsquo;s the bike that carries the heavy weight instead of my back, and it&rsquo;s awesome. I get wherever I&rsquo;m going without breaking a sweat, lock it up in 15 seconds and off I go. As far as convenience goes, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to beat.</p>

<p>The more I keep using it, the more I realize that this is exactly what an urban bicycle should be. Functional, discrete. Bombproof. I love it.</p>

<p>But then I look back at the Bianchi and, once again, I feel sad. Sad because even though I love nice things, I realize that sometimes, nice is not the best choice. Sometimes ugly is the answer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a lesson I&rsquo;m still struggling to assimilate, but I&rsquo;m making progress. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m quite ready to sell the Bianchi though. I still ride it occasionally, and enjoy it immensely. It is a wonderful piece of engineering and craftsmanship and, as someone who loves bicycles, it represents an ideal; the embodiment of my passion for these mechanical marvels.</p>

<p>We all have some guilty pleasures, and this is mine. Owning a nice bicycle makes me happy, even if it&rsquo;s not particularly useful, or practical.</p>

<p>Ugly certainly has its moments, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we have to forever let go of nice.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as far as bicycles are concerned, there&rsquo;s always <a href="http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#12">Rule  No. 12</a>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>This is what worldwide bicycle ambassador <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Colville-Andersen">Michael Colville-Andersen</a> very logically calls &ldquo;A-to-B-ism&rdquo;.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>For obvious sentimental reasons, I hesitate to call it an upgrade.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>There&rsquo;s something special about restoring an old object and giving it new life. That&rsquo;s why I always prefer restoring old bicycles as opposed to buying new ones, with the Bianchi as the sole exception.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>&ldquo;How can you ride a bike without gears?&rdquo;, is a frequent favorite of mine.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>You should always ask for proof of ownership when dealing with used items on the Internet. Otherwise you risk ending up with a stolen bike. If no proof of ownership exists, my advice is to pass on it. Or at the very least, use this <a href="http://www.findforms.com/single_example.php/example/396/Free_Basic_Sale_of_Goods_Contract">sample contract</a>. It&rsquo;s a good way to protect yourself against any possible theft claims that could come your way in the future. <a href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
