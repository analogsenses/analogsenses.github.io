<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, among other announcements, Apple introduced the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air-2/">iPad Air 2</a>, the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini-3/">iPad mini 3</a> and upgraded the long-neglected <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>. However, the real star of the show was the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/">iMac with Retina 5K display</a>. What an incredible machine.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go over each of the new hardware announcements in a bit more detail.</p>

<h2>The new iPads</h2>

<p>Last year, Apple upgraded the iPad mini and gave it the same internals as the then-flagship iPad Air. Actually, both machines were so similar that it didn&rsquo;t really make sense to call one of them the flagship. They were, for all practical purposes, the same device in two different sizes.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This time around, though, things have changed.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3931/15371042348_d767eea2d7_o.png"/></p>




<p class="photo-credit">(iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. Photo: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/">Apple</a>)</p>


<p>The iPad Air 2 is a typical year-over-year upgrade from Apple: it is thinner, a bit lighter, it has Touch ID, a much better camera and it&rsquo;s powered by a faster chip.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It also got a new laminated display and an anti-reflective coating, which should slightly improve the viewing experience, particularly in brightly lit places.</p>

<p>All in all, the iPad Air 2 is a nice upgrade that should make an already excellent device even more enjoyable to use. It&rsquo;s not a dramatic improvement over the first-generation iPad Air, though. After all, the Air was already thin enough for most people, myself included. I&rsquo;ve owned an iPad Air for over 6 months, and not once did I look at it and say to myself: &ldquo;Gee, I love my iPad, if only it were a bit thinner it would be perfect&rdquo;. If you already have an Air, I honestly see no compelling reason to upgrade, other than you can spare the money. Anything older, though, and the upgrade is much more compelling.</p>

<p>As a side note, it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder every year to get excited about a thinner and lighter version of what is essentially the same product. That could be a factor in the sales slump the iPad has suffered this past year. The typical refresh cycle for a tablet seems to be significantly longer than for a phone; 2 or 3-year-old iPads are still being happily used and enjoyed by their owners, who probably don&rsquo;t feel the same pressure to upgrade as they do with their iPhones. Not to mention that carrier subsidies contribute quite a bit to the phone-upgrade frenzy — spending $200 on a new phone every couple years is much easier to digest than buying a $600 tablet to replace the perfectly good one you already have.</p>

<p>The iPad mini 3 is a very different story, though. If you didn&rsquo;t buy one last year thinking that this year&rsquo;s version would be the one to get&hellip; well, you were wrong. Sorry about that. Apple took last year&rsquo;s iPad mini with a Retina Display — now retroactively called iPad mini 2 — added Touch ID, a gold color option and called it a day. The iPad mini 3 is still powered by the same A7 chip as last year&rsquo;s model, it&rsquo;s just as thin and light — which, to be fair, is not bad at all — and judging from a picture in <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-now-taking-pre-orders-ipad-mini-3-ipad-air-2">this article on iMore</a>, it still has the same narrower color gamut display.</p>

<p>If Apple had replaced the iPad mini 2 with the 3 while maintaining the price, people wouldn&rsquo;t have much reason to be excited, but the 3 would still make sense as a product. However, Apple decided to keep the iPad mini 2 in the lineup and dropped the price by a hundred bucks. Call me crazy but at $299, the iPad mini 2 seems like a far better deal. Touch ID and a gold color choice, while nice things to have, are not worth $100, in my opinion.</p>

<p>My advice if you&rsquo;re considering buying the entry-level, $399 iPad mini 3, is to get the $349 32GB iPad mini 2 instead. It&rsquo;s just a better use of your money: you get twice the storage capacity and you get to save 50 bucks. However, if you do need 64 GB of storage — and many people do — your only option is the iPad mini 3.</p>

<p>Oh, and Apple also decided to keep the original iPad mini and sell it for $249. I can&rsquo;t even begin to understand why someone would buy it over the iPad mini 2, but there it is. Make of it what you will.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of the iPad mini form factor, the worst part of yesterday&rsquo;s event is that Apple all but confirmed its role as a second-class citizen in the iPad lineup. Last year&rsquo;s refresh now seems like a fluke, and we are left to think that the mini will probably remain one generation behind the Air for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>The upgraded Mac Mini</h2>

<p>Not much to say here, other than the obvious. The Mac mini got a decent upgrade with faster processors and a new starting price of $499. After two years without being upgraded, the smallest member of the Mac family is once again an attractive entry-level option into the OS X ecosystem. Not bad.</p>

<h2>The iMac with Retina 5K display</h2>

<p>This is the computer we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for ever since we saw our first Retina display. For some, that goes as back as the iPhone 4 — for me personally, it was the 4S. It&rsquo;s such a striking difference that you must see it with your own eyes to really believe it. However, even though Apple has been relentlessly pushing display technology forward for years, a true desktop Retina experience remained elusive, until now.</p>

<p class="extra-width"><img class="extra-width" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5602/15557182885_a1e7a8be91_o.png"/></p>




<p class="photo-credit">(iMac with Retina 5K display. Photo: <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/">Apple</a>)</p>


<p>I have to say, I&rsquo;m impressed they could pull it off, and at this price: $2499 for that display alone would be a bargain. Considering it comes with a pretty good computer inside, it feels unreal. Granted, it&rsquo;s still a lot of money, but if you&rsquo;ve ever stared at a Retina display, you know it&rsquo;s worth every penny. I can&rsquo;t wait to see one of these in person.</p>

<p>iMacs are extraordinarily resilient machines. Mine is from early 2008 and it&rsquo;s still in perfect working condition. It&rsquo;s an investment you&rsquo;ll never regret.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Apple event wasn&rsquo;t particularly exciting or jam-packed with incredible announcements, but it marked another step forward for Apple and the maturity of their ecosystem. We&rsquo;ve finally come to a point where all Apple devices are able to seamlessly communicate and work with each other. From the outside this may look deceptively easy, but it&rsquo;s the result of many years' worth of work. It&rsquo;s a cheesy line, I&rsquo;ll admit, but it&rsquo;s absolutely true that only Apple could create an experience as cohesive and solid as this, and we&rsquo;re only just beginning to realize its potential.</p>

<p>Whether you own a Mac or an iOS device — or both — this is a great time to be an Apple user.</p>

<p>The only real differences last year were that the iPad mini had a slightly slower version of the same processor and a display panel with a narrower color gamut.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>Interestingly, Apple chose not to go with its A8 chip — the same one they used in last month&rsquo;s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus — and instead opted for a different design, dubbed A8X, which is probably a tweaked version of the A8 to improve its graphics performance.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
