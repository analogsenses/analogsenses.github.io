    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&rsquo;s long-rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro was announced this week, and it seems to pack many of the upgrades people were desperately hoping for, and a few others that nobody saw coming.</p>

<p>But we need to talk about that keyboard.</p>

<p><section class="photoset">

</section></p>

<p>Back in 2015, in their quest to make even thinner laptops, Apple designed a new keyboard with what they called &ldquo;butterfly-type switches&rdquo;, which allowed for impossibly shallow key travel. This new switch type effectively achieved their thinness goal and even provided better stability, but unfortunately it came with two pretty severe tradeoffs.</p>

<p>The first of those tradeoffs was feel. Such a shallow key travel makes for a very different typing experience, and I do mean different. I hesitate to call it worse because the truth is a lot more nuanced than that. Yes, many people hated this keyboard, but many also quickly adjusted to it, and some even preferred it to the experience of the previous one. If I had to come up with a word to accurately characterize this keyboard it wouldn&rsquo;t be worse, it would be polarizing.</p>

<p>Which, if you&rsquo;re Apple, is one the last things you want your keyboard to be.</p>

</section></p>

<p>I own a 2017 15-inch MacBook Pro and personally, I&rsquo;m slightly at odds with its keyboard&rsquo;s feel. Even though I don&rsquo;t hate typing on it, I also don&rsquo;t love it nearly as much as any other Apple keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever used. But typing feel alone wouldn&rsquo;t be enough for me to not own this laptop. I love this computer to death, and I appreciate having this much horsepower in such a svelte form factor. I&rsquo;m certainly willing to put up with its different typing experience if that&rsquo;s what it takes to get it, and I suspect I&rsquo;m not alone in that.</p>

<p>But then when we get to the second tradeoff: reliability.</p>

<p>As it turns out, having only 0.5 mm of key travel makes it quite easy for debris to become lodged underneath the key switches, effectively rendering them unable to function. What that means is that, over the life of this keyboard, you will probably experience some strange behavior in one or — depending how unlucky you get — more keys. Sometimes they may become sticky and lose their feel entirely. Other times, they may simply get stuck. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll be typing and you&rsquo;ll get missing letters or repeated ones. And if a key gets stuck while depressed you&rsquo;ll see and endless string of repeated characters.</p>

<p>Sounds wonderful, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

        <p class="caption">The shallow key travel of only 0.5 mm introduced some serious reliability issues</p>
    </figure></notextile></div>
</section></p>

<p>Of course, no laptop keyboard is truly immune to dust, but how often the problem occurs actually matters. A lot. On the record, Apple has always publicly stated that the problem only affects &ldquo;a small percentage&rdquo; of computers with butterfly keyboards. We have no reliable numbers to know for sure, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the issue is a lot more widespread than Apple would have us believe. So much so that they had to launch <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">a special repair program</a> for it.</p>

<p>Whatever the actual numbers may be, if that small percentage was significantly higher than in previous keyboards, that alone would be bad-enough to merit scrapping the design altogether. But don&rsquo;t worry, it gets worse.</p>

<p>Because this keyboard is effectively unrepairable.</p>

<p>In their quest to make the keyboard as thin as possible, Apple designed the key caps in such a way that they&rsquo;re nearly impossible to remove without breaking the little hooks that hold them in place. If you&rsquo;re not extremely careful, you may even damage the butterfly switch itself. Some keys, like the space bar, simply can&rsquo;t be removed without breaking.</p>

<p><section class="photoset">
    <div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class="full-width">
        <a class="fancybox" rel="galleryMButterfly4" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49078372767_f5dcb66ca4_o.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49078372767_f5dcb66ca4_o.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p class="caption">Some keys are impossible to remove without breaking, making repairability a nightmare</p>
    </figure></notextile></div>
</section></p>

<p>All of this makes it extremely difficult for users to clean their own keyboards. And even worse, every time you get a stuck key, you need to have the entire computer serviced. Which sounds bad enough, but hey, if it really only affects a small percentage of units then it&rsquo;s not such a big deal, is it?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about percentages, but it&rsquo;s already happened to me twice. And that&rsquo;s two times too many.</p>

<p>There is an Apple Autorized Service Provider a 5-minute walk away from my home. Last week, I had to get my right Shift key replaced because it had become unresponsive. Once I took it in, they replaced the key in under 5 minutes. Less than half an hour after I left home, I was back inside with a fixed computer. It was impressive.</p>

<p>However, as great as the service was, the point is I never should have needed to take it in in the first place. Certainly not because of a goddamned sticky key.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s clearly the most optimistic scenario possible. If you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have a service provider near you, getting your computer fixed can easily take several days, or even weeks. I know because I&rsquo;ve also had to go through that on account of — you guessed it — another sticky key. That time I took it directly into an Apple Store and they replaced the entire top case, but I was left without a Mac for about 10 days. No matter how much they tried to take care of me, that&rsquo;s simply unacceptable.</p>

<p>In just over two years of ownership, I&rsquo;ve had to have this computer serviced twice. I don&rsquo;t recall any other Apple product I&rsquo;ve ever owned — and it&rsquo;s a long list — where that&rsquo;s been the case. No matter how you look at it, the butterfly keyboard seems to be one of the worst hardware mistakes Apple has ever made. Yes, even worse than Antennagate.</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>There are many headline-grabbing features about the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro I&rsquo;m sure Apple would want us to talk about, but I&rsquo;m afraid we need to keep talking about the keyboard. Because with the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple finally ditched the butterfly switches and designed a new keyboard that goes back to the more traditional scissor-type switches.</p>

<p><section class="photoset">

        <p class="caption">The 16-inch MacBook Pro&rsquo;s keyboard brings back the physical escape key that was removed in the butterfly keyboard</p>
    </figure></notextile></div>
</section></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a new old keyboard, if you will. They&rsquo;re even calling it the Magic Keyboard, in case you weren&rsquo;t paying attention. It&rsquo;s almost cute.</p>

<p>It also gives us another couple of features people had been calling for: a physical escape key, and inverted T arrow keys. We already had both of those before Apple took them away, of course, but pay no attention to that. The important part is, they&rsquo;re back. Life&rsquo;s good. Rejoyce.</p>

<p>With this new old design, Apple is clearly hoping people will stop talking about their laptop keyboards for good. They seem desperate for it to go back to being a boring, utilitarian feature nobody even thinks about: it&rsquo;s good, it does what it&rsquo;s supposed to, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. <em>It just works</em>. End of story.</p>

<p>For now.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s plenty to love about the new 16-inch MacBook Pro beyond its new keyboard: a bigger screen, much better speakers, greatly improved thermals and a bigger battery are all pretty compelling features, and make this by far the best MacBook Pro Apple has ever made.</p>

<p>And yet, all everybody keeps talking about is the keyboard.</p>

<p><section class="photoset">

        <p class="caption">The new keyboard also brings back the inverted T arrow key layout</p>
    </figure></notextile></div>
</section></p>

<p>You see, the 15-ish inch MacBook Pro has always been Apple&rsquo;s flagship laptop. I&rsquo;d even go so far as to say it&rsquo;s their flagship Mac, period. It&rsquo;s not the most powerful, but it&rsquo;s the Mac they depend on to satisfy the demands of most of their professional users and as such, it&rsquo;s a no-bullshit computer. This is where Apple has always put in their best efforts, and added new features only when they were absolutely sure it was worth the risk of tweaking this winning formula. Or at least that used to be the case, before the butterfly keyboard and the Touch Bar and the Thunderbolt-only ports — but don&rsquo;t even get me started on those.</p>

<p>My point is, a new MacBook Pro being a great computer should surprise no one. That&rsquo;s the bar Apple set for itself long ago and has been raising time and time again with each new generation. Another great MacBook Pro is just the normal state of the universe, and not newsworthy in the least. It&rsquo;s a boring product, and that&rsquo;s exactly the way Apple likes it. But a 15-inch MacBook Pro failing to meet Apple&rsquo;s own lofty standards? Now that&rsquo;s some news for you.</p>

<p>Despite Apple&rsquo;s best efforts to <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/1194613277227208705">confess nothing</a>, the fact that we&rsquo;re all still talking about the keyboard is entirely a trap of their own making.</p>

<p>So where does that leave us?</p>

<p>Well, if you&rsquo;ve been holding on to that beloved 2015 MacBook Pro of yours, waiting for Apple to get their keyboard act together, it appears you&rsquo;re in luck. Upgrading to the 2019 MacBook Pro should be a no-brainer, especially considering the price. With 512 GB of storage and 16 GB of RAM, the base model in particular is the best value I&rsquo;ve seen in a MacBook Pro in a <em>really</em> long time.</p>

<p>However, while I&rsquo;m fairly certain I won&rsquo;t be keeping my 2017 MacBook Pro for much longer, I&rsquo;m still trying to decide if I&rsquo;m going to upgrade to the 16-inch model. It&rsquo;s not just about the keyboard anymore, but also the way a Mac laptop fits into my current lifestyle. With the new productivity features in iOS 13, perhaps it&rsquo;s finally time for me to give the iPad Pro a fair shot at becoming my mobile computer. For the most part, I don&rsquo;t need the horsepower that the new MacBook Pro brings to the table, and I would certainly appreciate the significantly smaller and lighter form factor of the iPad when I&rsquo;m away from my desk.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s a story for another day.</p>

    <updated>2017-02-02T21:51:48+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.analogsenses.com/2017/02/02/on-the-future-of-computing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week Apple published their latest <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3163463/macs/apples-q1-2017-records-for-the-iphone-and-services-but-the-ipad-still-struggles.html">quarterly results</a>, including record revenue and iPhone sales. Meanwhile, though, iPad sales were once again down year-over-year, in a trend that’s starting to get too long to ignore.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a fair bit about the future of the iPad lately. <a href="https://marco.org/2017/01/31/the-wrong-future">This recent article</a> by Marco Arment does a good job of summarizing how I feel about it:</p>

<blockquote><p>What if the iPad <em>isn’t</em> the future of computing?</p>

<p>What if, like so much in technology, it’s mostly just additive, rather than largely replacing PCs and Macs, and furthermore had a cooling-fad effect as initial enthusiasm wore off and customers came to this conclusion?</p></blockquote>

<p>That sounds about right to me. I’ve owned an iPad ever since the iPad 2 was released in early 2011, almost six years ago. Since then, I’ve also owned an iPad 3 — the first iPad with a Retina screen, which was absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> — and now an iPad Air (first generation), which is the newest computing device in my house aside from my iPhone 6S. It’s <em>way</em> more modern than both my 2008 iMac and my 2010 MacBook Pro, and still runs pretty much as fast as it did when I bought it.</p>

<p>I’ve used and loved every one of my iPads, but a few months ago I started noticing a worrying trend. It doesn’t feel like it, but the truth is I haven’t regularly used my iPad Air in a very long time. So long in fact, that the last couple of times I reached out for it I discovered it was out of battery. And these things take a <em>long</em> time to discharge.</p>

<p>If I try to remember the last time I was amazed by an iPad app, I draw a blank. I just can’t seem to find a use case for it. When I’m on the couch I prefer to use the MacBook, and when I’m at my desk I’d much rather use the iMac. The rest of the time, well, that’s what the iPhone is for.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything I do on a computing device is easier to do or just plain <em>better</em> to do on either one of my Macs than it is on the iPad, and I can’t find anything in my workflow that can <em>only</em> be done on the iPad. Figuring out the right workflow and combination of apps to accomplish fairly trivial tasks seems like an awful lot of work most of the time, and at some point I guess I simply stopped trying. Plus, to be fair, I <em>love</em> the Mac. I always have, and I’m not looking to replace mine anytime soon.</p>

<p>Your mileage may of course vary, but at the end of the day, I believe that’s the problem for me: I just <em>prefer</em> the Mac platform, and it’s going to take more than feature parity for the iPad to eclipse that.</p>

<p>I suppose it could just be that I’m too set in my own ways to appreciate the wonders of the iPad. I’m well aware I’m not your typical consumer, but what if I’m not in the minority here? What if most people, regular consumers included, feel the same way?</p>

<h2>Skating to where the puck is going to be</h2>

<p>If the iPad is to be the future of computing, it doesn’t just need to be able to do the same things we do on a Mac today, it needs to unlock entirely new ideas and tasks that we never even thought to attempt on the Mac. That’s the path forward, and it’s all about the software.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s anyone left out there complaining that their iPads are not fast enough these days, or that battery life isn’t good enough. Similarly, screens are gorgeous, storage is ample, and wireless connectivity is better than ever. By all accounts, the iPad is a mature product line hardware-wise, and yet it is still very much in its infancy when it comes to software.</p>

<p>The early days of iOS on the iPad were extremely promising, as the larger canvas enabled third party developers to come up with lots of really innovative ideas. However, somewhere along the way development of iPad-specific features in iOS seemed to stall and it never meaningfully picked up again, leaving many of those developers hamstrung by the limitations of the OS.</p>

<p>What does a mature and advanced OS for the iPad look like? I have no idea, but I can’t help but feel there’s still a lot of untapped potential for it. There has to be.</p>

<p>There’s a problem, though. In order to move the needle, Apple will probably need to increase the resources they’re putting into the development of iPad-specific — or even iPad-only — iOS features, and as of today, iPad sales numbers don’t seem to warrant that. It’s a bit of a catch-22: sales probably won’t pick up until Apple makes substantial improvements to iOS, but Apple can’t reasonably justify investing resources to make those improvements because current sales numbers are not only poor, they’re actually getting worse.</p>

<p>How to break the cycle, then? Enter Tim Cook.</p>

<p>For more than a few quarters now, Tim Cook has used the term “bullish” to describe his attitude towards the future of the iPad. This is a long-term game, and Cook appears to be convinced that the iPad has what it takes to bring about the next massive shift in computing for the masses. It’s a noble goal, and if there’s a company out there with the right corporate DNA to pull it off, it’s certainly Apple.</p>

<p>So far, it’s clear that Tim Cook plans to continue to invest in the iPad. But in the absence of strong sales, how long can he keep it up?</p>

<p>Look to WWDC in June for the first signs of change. If iOS 11 brings substantial new features for the iPad, it could very well signal the beginning of a historic turnaround. However, if Apple continues to neglect the iPad to focus on the — admittedly <em>much</em> more profitable — iPhone, we may have to start looking for the future elsewhere.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

    <link href="http://www.analogsenses.com/2016/12/13/a-review-of-the-15-inch-macbook-pro-with-touch-bar/"/>
    <updated>2016-12-13T18:10:21+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.analogsenses.com/2016/12/13/a-review-of-the-15-inch-macbook-pro-with-touch-bar</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To say that new MacBook Pros are controversial machines would be the understatement of the year.</p>

<p>On one hand, they’re thinner and lighter, they have better displays, and even a brand-new input interface: the Touch Bar. On the other hand, they’re not any faster than last year’s models, they have <em>worse</em> battery life, and they are significantly more expensive. Sounds like a recipe for Internet disaster.</p>

<p>Of course, in actual use and once the smoke of online reviews clears, these are excellent machines, and largely a meaningful improvement over the previous generation. Can’t help but feel I’ve lived through this before.</p>

<p>Now, I’ve read <em>many</em> reviews of the new MacBook Pros, and watched even more video reviews on YouTube, and the aforelinked one by Josh Ginter is by far my favorite. Not only is it beautifully photographed — as usual — but he does an outstanding job of describing how it is to actually live with one of these machines. I particularly loved this bit:</p>

<blockquote><p>Within the first week of using the MacBook Pro, I noticed I had been editing <em>more</em> photos than on the iMac. Why? Because I wasn’t as afraid to enter into the “Develop” module on a photo that didn’t pass the “first impression test.” Because I can get in and out of the Develop module so quickly and because I can make edits faster than ever, I take more chances on photos I wouldn’t have had before. As a result, I have more keepers than I originally thought.</p>

<p>So, do the marginal, underwhelming, and even non-existent improvements add up to a poorer experience? Absolutely not. Instead, I’m able to work faster than ever and have more photographs to show off as a result. If you make photographs for a living, photographs are money. Which means this MacBook Pro’s improved storage performance can essentially pay for itself in the long run.</p></blockquote>

<p>Who cares if the specs are not better than last year’s on paper? At the end of the day, the set of features and compromises in the new MacBook Pros will amount to a better experience for most people. That’s what Apple has always done, and that’s just what these machines do: bring the future here faster in order to make our collective computing experiences <em>better</em>. There will be growing pains along the way, sure, but it’s the only way we’re ever going to get there.</p>

<p>I’m ordering one.</p>
