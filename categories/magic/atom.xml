    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This documentary looks amazing. One of my closest friends is a magician, and through him I&rsquo;ve learned to appreciate and love this beautiful craft. I can&rsquo;t wait to see it.</p>

<p>By the way, seeing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Tamariz">Juan Tamariz</a> in the trailer made me feel quite emotional. He&rsquo;s a living legend, a truly beloved icon in the world of magic. I remember I used to watch him perform unbelievable tricks on TV back when I was a little kid, and I was always enchanted by his character. A couple of years ago I finally got to meet the man  — alongside my friend — and it was one of the most, well, magical experiences of my life.</p>
