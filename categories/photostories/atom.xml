    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ah, Paris. The City of Light. So much has been written about this beautiful city that I feel there’s nothing else I could add that would do it justice.</p>

<p>But it’s not just writers that are fascinated by Paris’s unique atmosphere. Au contraire. All kinds of artists have been inspired to produce their best work by this enchanting city: painters, photographers, actors, musicians, you name it. There’s just something special about it that seems to wake our imagination like perhaps no other place on this planet.</p>

<p>Paris is one of a kind, so when Miriam and I decided a few weeks ago that we would be spending New Year’s Eve there, my brain was immediately filled to the brink with wild expectations.</p>

<p>Since a regular article wouldn’t be appropriate for such a wonderful city, I came up with something that&rsquo;s new for the site: a photo story.</p>

<p>Just follow the title link to get to the beginning. I do hope you’ll enjoy it as much as we did.</p>
