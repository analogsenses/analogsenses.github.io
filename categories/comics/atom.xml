    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great news over at <em>The Mary Sue</em>. It appears one of my favorite graphic novels is going to make its way to the small screen soon. Jessica Lachenal:</p>

<blockquote><p>For those of you who don’t know, <em>Y: The Last Man</em> is a series of graphic novels revolving around a singular premise: a mysterious virus has killed all men on Earth except for one man. It’s an <em>amazing</em> novel, one that you absolutely should pick up reading <em>now</em>, with a really gripping story that explores the dynamics of gender roles in a world where there are no more men.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yep. I can’t wait.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really, really enjoyed this essay by Joseph Rooks on <em>One Piece</em>, the best-selling Manga series by Eiichiro Oda:</p>

<blockquote><p>The beauty of One Piece isn’t in checking-off a shopping list of story elements, but in pushing the limits of just how much imagination and detail a human being can pour into twenty pages of art and storytelling week after week, for fifteen years and counting.</p>

<p>Oda has a talent for weaving disparate details together, collected from every cultural and historical source he can absorb, to create something new and exciting. This skill is most apparent in the colorful designs of his characters and the settings in which they are introduced.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>One Piece</em> is creativity in its purest form, definitely a must-read.</p>
