    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nice interview with one of my favorite actresses over at <em>The Talks</em>, from 2012:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s a weird obsession that I find very sad, because I think it’s okay to age. Who cares if you get older? It’s not such a big deal. I’m not very attached to my looks either. I know it’s weird because as an actress I should care, but I don’t. I’ve never done Botox - I don’t want to do it, it terrifies me. Maybe people think that I am crazy for not doing Botox, but I don’t care. It’s a form of insecurity. I think Botox is a form of madness. Some people will say it’s great, but I think it’s a form of neurosis, of sickness. It’s the same kind of obsession as people who throw up to stay skinny. People shouldn’t be so obsessed with their appearance; they should care about who they are.</p></blockquote>

<p>Solid point, although comparing Botox with “throwing up to stay skinny” is a huge oversimplification and, frankly, quite tone-deaf.</p>

<p>That said, it is a testament to my fascination with Julie Delpy that she can get away with calling <em>Forrest Gump</em> “a stupid film”, and somehow I still like her.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fantastic video montage by Jacob T. Swinney:</p>

<blockquote><p>Before I knew what a director was, I knew who Steven Spielberg was. I believe that this is partially due to the fact that Spielberg has crafted some of the most iconic shots in all of cinema. Many filmmakers have that one signature shot that will forever solidify them in film history&ndash; Spielberg has dozens. This video showcases the work of Steven Spielberg in 30 memorable shots, one from each of his full-length films. From something as magical as a silhouetted bicycle streaking across the moon, to something as simple as tiny ripples in a cup of water, this is Steven Spielberg.</p></blockquote>
